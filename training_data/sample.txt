Well, well, well.. ITS THE CLIMBBBB!!!
@Lucidscience do you know when hammond comes out?
@Dzurek Im thinking that hammond will be released into quick play around like July 20th-25th, but we wont see him in competitive play until we are nearing the end of Season 11
well i'm coaching a team and when hammond comes out mcree becomes better than hanzo and widow for long range duels
I feel like mcree will be ran more or less as a counter to hammond because of his stun, widowmaker and hanzo will still counter a mcree
Just because of mcrees damage dropoff on long distance shots
Hanzo and widowmaker are the king and queen of long distance fights
lucid
when are you streaming
4pm est goofballl
what time is it for you
1
Hammond's hardest counters so far are looking to be Mei, Reaper, Brigitte, Mcree, Doomfist
1:00

CLASSIC
What have you sloots been up to hahah
quitting Overwatch and going back to TF2.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
why DUDE
blizzard ruined it with the "new" heroes.
no way man
Overwatch is in a really good place right now
Also, 8000 hours on TF2 shows how much it came bring me back to it.
even with the grav dragon meta
It's just boring
i guess it depends on what heroes you enjoy playing and whether or not they fit into the meta ;P
Being a Support/Tank main isn't very fun when you main Sniper in TF2 for 2400 hours.
ehhh i feel thatt
welcome @Hawk !!!!!
Hey\
hey hey hey!
hi hawk long tim no c
So Lucid
someone explained it like this. Mcree is a better widow and hanzo for the simple fact that you have to charge up a shot and a good mcree can double headshot you before that charge is ready. Mcree's only problem is his ult... Still
this is true, mcree will be a lot stronger once hammond is released
in this meta, hanzo is strictly a better mcree
WELCOME @Meerkattac !!!!!!!!!! :lucids5BigHUGE:
I hate hand job 😡
huuuuh hahah
Hanzo
ohhh hahaha
HANDJOB INCOMING

Menthol shaving cream, spray it all over your burn. It’ll soothe redness and give a cooling sensation
You’re welcome
Are you sure???
Better than aloe??
I mean aloe is still the best natural thing
If you needed a quick fix the shaving cream hack is bomb
Okeeey thanks!

Phat sleeeps
STREAMING TIME. Now I've got a cam and a "Green Screen"
Lets go duude
Literally comp makes no sens
Play like a real person, lose every game. Play like a thrower, win games
I played rein, and literally walked to the door on hanamura attack, and charged. We got the point
das how your're're suppo0sed to play rein
Hey man, sometimes all you need is a charge, good or bad, to make enough space for your teammates 😂🤣
hey man **puts shield down** sometimes you just **misses firestrike** gotta SMASH **shatter gets stunned by brig** that shift key **charges off cliff**
xD
Oh my God that felt relatable
The Reinhardt struggle hahaha
I should stop playing Ana like a healer, and start playing her like a flanker, that'll teach my team.
I did that on eichenwalde last. My whole team died and I managed to hide up at the mega near the dark souls reference.
When my team came back in I ambushed the widow and killed her then killed mercy as she retreated from my team.
Then casually walked THROUGH THEIR REIN SHIELD back to my team.
bahahaha flank ana INCOMINGGGG

@Dzurek a good mcree/brigitte can counter a doomfist very well. Always being aware of where the doomfist is as those heroes, and stepping in at the right times to make sure he gets shut down

Team Titans.
i like it.
Sounds good
okay, now i got it
This is your logo
That was gonna be my logo
Ohwell
Awkward
Sorry 😦
Thats a kappa
No, but seriously, if we need a team logo, i got this.
i'll maybe edit it tomorrow to suit a true logo
Ok, we WILL use it
And if I don't get a logo then I'll make one >:)
I'll colour it tommrrow and add some WOW to it
If not, i'll use either the Genji or Sombra one
When you find out that after you left a server because they were cunts, that a bunch of other people told them off and left too  👌

Dude that logo is sweet aha!!
@Cass I destroyed an entire community because the owner was a tyrant, and i got all the admins to ban everyone and reinvite them to a new discord.

You both are spamming my Discord. Stop that.
I can tell them to stop, but I can't make them. I'm fully aware of that.
i mean you could also just mute the server when you dont want to be disturbed
I was a meanie I’m sorry kizmet
I can make a spam channel for peeps
Then anyone who doesn’t want spam can mute that channel
Sorry for being grumpy. I only had 2 hours of sleep tonight.

ill just remove the background if we need to
Omg @Skeleton Yardel it looks like splatoon tracer
I love
it was made by someone on Reddit, i've asked if i can use it for our logo
it was either this, Genji or Sombra
Trying to make this my teams logo
🤣😂
You should make Hammond in pop team epics art style
Lol I can try
Playing on American servers causes me to have VERY slight lag, enough to play, but enough to make Tracer unusable against stuns
the Rubberbanding it too much
:odelbeBall:
@Skeleton Yardel are you in EU then i take it?
yup
Can i change my team name?
Team Heal up is now officially our name

Register yourself as a free agent, or look through the teams to see if there’s any open slots!
If we have enough free agents, they can all form into a team (:
I’m not sure how many we have right now, but definitely make an account and register now
the list of free agents is a little skewed as some are in a team but the team is still pending
we'll be needing a fourth captain for the next group of available free agents right now
I'm so happy at my team logo.
i nailed it
also if anyone is worried, look for an alternate for your team just in case!
good morning everybody!!!!!!!!!
🌞
I'd like to say that I'll be placing bets on  team KING'S ROW GODS to win kings row @roses
💦
LOL
its WET
i just made it
what a logo dude
should almost take kings row off the roster just cause your team is gonna dominate it so hard
If kings row goes i go Kappa
4real tho favorite map of all time
best map NA
But it's  in England.
Love losing 4 placements because of Widows and Genjis
ur mum's in england
🐟
I love leaving master 23 times and then dropping 300 SR
bruhh haha
you guys are br00tu1
Grazie
i love falling out of top 500 twice and then losing games in GM because of people just trying to enjoy the game playing Ana but actually throwing because shes the worst support pick right now
Why do people even still play Ana
Okay, I agreed with some of that, ana is still good if the ana player is good
if you watch ml7
its actually really messed up that no matter how good an Ana is, you still lose fights because of no rez and teammates getting out of Ana's line of sight for healing
yea that is true
@FireDragon ml7 is one of the few exceptions just because hes god tier with Ana, but he still loses because of this
I hate games that still want to run hanzo strat no matter what, or when sym came out again
yeah it is kind of a resident sleeper moment when its grav dragon combo to win every game haha
Welp I have a Diamond tank account and now a bronze dps account megaoof
should of gotten a fresh account instead of an account already in bronze
Hahahba
THE CLIMB
i got Diamond!
2-8
@Skeleton Yardel VERY nice dude!!!!
with just Soldier
Hey man, hitscan are making a comeback!!
Well
We're all soldiers now
It's my lucky dragons skin.
@Skeleton Yardel are you able to confirm your team on battlefy?
I'm sitting on the team roster skin, where now?
it should be somewhere within your team settings
Okay, think it's done
@Skeleton Yardel it is!! Good stuff dude!
ASS is our Rivals!
i can  explain
You're gonna get these 76 hands boi

3:43 is hard to beat
minutes xD
could've given me more context. i need the context
well what game of overwatch goes for 3:43 score
you have a brian for a reason
if I get confused on how to play a game when I have 8000 hours on it, then you can tell that my brain is slow
but you know what was funny, 14k damage and 41 elms as rein both gold but what did i get instead for the end card
fuck 8:30 objective time card
not 4 golds
@Pivot
Oof, been there. done that.
am i a pussy if i call out of work because im too sunburned
No depends, did you get a sunburn so bad that it feels like needles when you were a shirt?

That skin does look dope O.O
Yea I don’t like football unless we talking about futball or how it is spelled in spanish 😂
But the skin looks cool and it fits Reinhardt’s character
Plus the hammer is actually a trophy so i was wrong about the logo thing but still. You snack people with your victory trophy talk about a fuck you to the face
They also announced a new lucio ball map in that same tweet!!
Busan is a new South Korean arena that semi leaked a while back
And he says touchdown instead of hammer down. jk
That would be amazing tho
Work at blizzard
LOL
Ten bucks says he does though because the genji skins do a voice line change depending on the skin, mccree, and hanzo
English better?
& mercy in her witch skin has a different voice line
Sombra has some too
I never knew dis
Wahht
There’s also a zen one too

A couple of these were just event voice lines but not skin specific
Still crazy how many there are lol
So you never heard mccree say It's high tide in his summer skin or hanzo have a different voice which says the wolf instead of the dragon?
oh definitely I just didn't know about the mercy and sombra ones and a lot of the rest that aren't as prevalent. I guess I'm more focused on putting kids in the durt than listening to voice lines. Only the ults I know are going to get my ass kicked
Spit on him
hahah i feel the same as Donna, i only know the ultimate voice lines because i know to look out for them in game xD thats really sweet th0
Spit on who now? Children? Heee heee
NOT THE CHILDREN!!!

Only widow

@Zachary may have some advice...he's a very good widow
😃
Add me or hit me up if you need or want some training, I’ve got suggestions from what I have learned personally
@Nuvalin
Dude why TF is Biggby coffee so expensive 😭
What the fuqqq
Because they cash in off people's addictions and because every cup has 45 grams of sugar in it
HAHAHAHAHA
And because you still bought it
@Gillian dont use my server as a platform to market your sr boosting thanks
Hey guys, if you are involved in the science fair tournament, please take a look at the #announcements  and #the-science-fair text channels
😎 💦
I got that message too lol blocked
BRINGIN DOWN THE BAN-HAMMER
#B005T3DN00BZ
@Lucidscience undeafen nerd
@Dzurek i was gettin f00d
lmao
So, when is my team going, i i've in the UK and i got work, is it later tonight
Look at the announcements channel @Skeleton Yardel
You will probably be tentative for around 4:30-5pm EST
And if you dont care if your match is streamed or not, you can just play the game at 3pm EST
Please read the information first
i got it, done with work fo the day
i'm bready
Except half my team isn't even on discord
Get ahold of them through their battletags
none of them have battle net open either
Who isnt on discord thats on your team. Send their battletag
They most likely go by a different name and are in this discord.
Consider me a fill for any team that needs a player if I'm around. Any role
I'll be home in like 2 hours
i did the math, if the matches start at 8:00 tonight america, then that's about midnight in the UK
Thank you @Zeinder! Awesome
Project your match is not going to start that late
Your maths are quite off
well, it will be pretty late
Well I work at 5est (Will have to leave in ~3hours), and won't be back till probably 8:30-9. So that's my everything for today
My evening for tomorrow is pretty free though
Very nice dude
@Skeleton Yardel if you would rather play right at 3pm, you have to ask the other team captain and agree on it. Just know that the match wont be streamed
I;m okay with the time
alright!
just as long as my team is here 😬
remember to stay tuned in to the stream to get an idea for when your game starts!!!
I have the 2nd lowest SR on my team
send help
@Pivot where TF are you
@Skeleton Yardel @roses are both of your teams ready to go?
i thought we were 2nd reeee

@Ship what team are you?

We didn't plan to play twice today so the teams already disbanded

Lest we didn't go 0-3

😭
surprised there was no 2-1's today
i know right
tommorow some ez 3-0's for Shadow Juice though
Cosmic is still last though
cosmic is gone
ah
RIP
RIP
We got 3-0'd tho
First match
Y I K E S
then 2-1
you'll go 3-0 to you next
I'm so confused
What
YOU DON'T SUCK
Okay thanks
You guys put one hell of a fight as well
Was a very close match
Like the whole thing
we'd done no scrimming beforehand, just QP matches an hour before
King's Row was yikes but we were like NAH WE ARE THE KING'S ROW GODS AND THIS IS AN EZ CLAP
Same
i even said after the game "they are called kings row gods, we'll give them that"
So, if we are in 3rd, we can still win?
well 3rd out of 5, so you have a good chance
er
two teams are tied for 1st so far, you still have 3 more rounds to do before finals, plenty of chances to get more points
2 more rounds
3 including finals
Are the standings kinda scuffed lol
Or do I not understand them
Dzurek and Anal are tied for first
You're second
project is 3rd
add up results, not the P
the P is weird
I know we can do better
my nerves let my team down i feel
Everyone did great today
It was a great time!!!
❤ (3) 💦 Lucid5BigHuge
it's more personally
but, the feeling of a tournament is now burned into me, so expect a better show next time
but watching the kings row match back, i can see SO many mistakes i made
sall good brah
Finally got back to masters
for the 24th time XD
I've almost got all 3 accounts in plat
Dps account is last one... and man it's hard...
I have to become those salty people who instalock dps and not switch
because i don't wanna play anything else...
Very noicee
I know the plat life all too well man
Yeah it's where u naturally belong
@Lucidscience
Plat chat
Kabji's aim guide is pain on the wrist and fingers XD
Luuul
Any know how to do tracer 180 flick properly, I get like 170 flinks XD
Dude i just got the big boy blowouts this afternoon straight scuffed as all hell
Actually cannot move
who's playing first today?
Wait what happened?
oof
i would like t not go up against KRG again
Lucid shit his pants
LIVE
OH shit XD
for real?
Oh btw if you guys want to watch Batman Gotham by Gaslight is really good
no dude wtf hahahaha
@Trashmankind xD
omegalul
Why has everyone just left all the teams
@Skeleton Yardel they havent, some people just cant play because of things they have going on during the weekend
i messaged @Webby123 , hopefully he replies soon
i just talked to him
@Skeleton Yardel pencil isnt gonna be here?
feelsbad

@Skeleton Yardel @MapleReign SENDING INVITES NOW

Can you
we need someone at this point
what type of dps do you need?
Any dps
im the 7th of reeformed, if you need me I can
mostly hitscan
COme here my boi
Pivot showed up 10 minutes late to the first game yesterday i highly doubt he'll show up right now

@Dzurek @Ship invites are being sent now
GOODLUCK!
Lucid want a co-caster XD
Haha next round!
gg's @Ship
ggs
i wish we put up a better fight the first two rounds but
baby rage op
are you guys a new team
yes sir
WELCOME @Grey Nalasan @Polarized @Moffsie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
💪
I feel like when i told them that i'm really strict that they took it for granted
hence why kiz and pivot both got kicked
i didnt get spectated enough 😡
@Ship i tried my best dude haha
GIVE ME ATTENTION
lol
Next time you run a tourney let me know 😃 would love to join in the fun
🤔
@Grey Nalasan what you play? (role wise)
I'm a flex player i will play whatever
I gotchu
but i prefer tanks/heals
how is it that i go from terrible in a tournament, to brilliant in solo q
We'll just have to come back next week harder than before
and maybe, with some luck, we might have a shot
@Skeleton Yardel the difference between comp and Tourney comp is like comparing Mars to Venus
I was wondering why my computer was going so slow
turns out it likes to do Security checks without telling me
Typical Windows 10 shit hahah
i still have windows 7
never updated
Ohhh
