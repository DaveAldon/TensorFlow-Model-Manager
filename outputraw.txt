Smorf around 41~

Well, well, well.. ITS THE CLIMBBBB!!!
@Lucidscience do you know when hammond comes out?
@Dzurek Im thinking that hammond will be released into quick play around like July 20th-25th, but we wont see him in competitive play until we are nearing the end of Season 11
well i'm coaching a team and when hammond comes out mcree becomes better than hanzo and widow for long range duels
I feel like mcree will be ran more or less as a counter to hammond because of his stun, widowmaker and hanzo will still counter a mcree
Just because of mcrees damage dropoff on long distance shots
Hanzo and widowmaker are the king and queen of long distance fights
lucid
when are you streaming
4pm est goofballl
what time is it for you
1
Hammond's hardest counters so far are looking to be Mei, Reaper, Brigitte, Mcree, Doomfist
1:00
Its 4pm est for me
When i start
i just woke up
But right now the time is 1pm
yea
because you  and donna ar3e 3 hours ahead of me

CLASSIC
What have you sloots been up to hahah
quitting Overwatch and going back to TF2.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
why DUDE
blizzard ruined it with the "new" heroes.
no way man
Overwatch is in a really good place right now
Also, 8000 hours on TF2 shows how much it came bring me back to it.
even with the grav dragon meta
It's just boring
i guess it depends on what heroes you enjoy playing and whether or not they fit into the meta ;P
Being a Support/Tank main isn't very fun when you main Sniper in TF2 for 2400 hours.
ehhh i feel thatt
welcome @Hawk !!!!!
Hey\
hey hey hey!
hi hawk long tim no c
So Lucid
someone explained it like this. Mcree is a better widow and hanzo for the simple fact that you have to charge up a shot and a good mcree can double headshot you before that charge is ready. Mcree's only problem is his ult... Still
this is true, mcree will be a lot stronger once hammond is released
in this meta, hanzo is strictly a better mcree
WELCOME @Meerkattac !!!!!!!!!! :lucids5BigHUGE:
I hate hand job 😡
huuuuh hahah
Hanzo
ohhh hahaha
HANDJOB INCOMING

The flexibility in philly's team is actually huge though
Like, hotba zen? I didn't see that coming. Well I did, but I questioned if it was a throw.
I feel like maybe boombox was just not feeling it
Off warming up if a map 4 happens
Wait, who'd jjonak nano?

I need to slather some aloe on it

Menthol shaving cream, spray it all over your burn. It’ll soothe redness and give a cooling sensation
You’re welcome
Are you sure???
Better than aloe??
I mean aloe is still the best natural thing
If you needed a quick fix the shaving cream hack is bomb
Okeeey thanks!

Phat sleeeps
STREAMING TIME. Now I've got a cam and a "Green Screen"
Lets go duude
Literally comp makes no sens
Play like a real person, lose every game. Play like a thrower, win games
I played rein, and literally walked to the door on hanamura attack, and charged. We got the point
das how your're're suppo0sed to play rein
Hey man, sometimes all you need is a charge, good or bad, to make enough space for your teammates 😂🤣
hey man **puts shield down** sometimes you just **misses firestrike** gotta SMASH **shatter gets stunned by brig** that shift key **charges off cliff**
xD
Oh my God that felt relatable
The Reinhardt struggle hahaha
I should stop playing Ana like a healer, and start playing her like a flanker, that'll teach my team.
I did that on eichenwalde last. My whole team died and I managed to hide up at the mega near the dark souls reference.
When my team came back in I ambushed the widow and killed her then killed mercy as she retreated from my team.
Then casually walked THROUGH THEIR REIN SHIELD back to my team.
bahahaha flank ana INCOMINGGGG

Lulll

Team Titans.
i like it.
Sounds good
okay, now i got it
This is your logo
That was gonna be my logo
Ohwell
Awkward
Sorry 😦
Thats a kappa
No, but seriously, if we need a team logo, i got this.
i'll maybe edit it tomorrow to suit a true logo
Ok, we WILL use it
And if I don't get a logo then I'll make one >:)
I'll colour it tommrrow and add some WOW to it
If not, i'll use either the Genji or Sombra one
When you find out that after you left a server because they were cunts, that a bunch of other people told them off and left too  👌
PogChamp
The ultimate POGGERS
BIG POGG
Dude that logo is sweet aha!!
@Cass I destroyed an entire community because the owner was a tyrant, and i got all the admins to ban everyone and reinvite them to a new discord.

You both are spamming my Discord. Stop that.
I can tell them to stop, but I can't make them. I'm fully aware of that.
i mean you could also just mute the server when you dont want to be disturbed
I was a meanie I’m sorry kizmet
I can make a spam channel for peeps
Then anyone who doesn’t want spam can mute that channel
Sorry for being grumpy. I only had 2 hours of sleep tonight.

WHAT
Png had all that white pixel around the side
ew no
ill just remove the background if we need to
Omg @Skeleton Yardel it looks like splatoon tracer
I love
it was made by someone on Reddit, i've asked if i can use it for our logo
it was either this, Genji or Sombra
Trying to make this my teams logo
🤣😂
You should make Hammond in pop team epics art style
Lol I can try
Playing on American servers causes me to have VERY slight lag, enough to play, but enough to make Tracer unusable against stuns
the Rubberbanding it too much
:odelbeBall:
@Skeleton Yardel are you in EU then i take it?
yup
Can i change my team name?
Team Heal up is now officially our name
Heck ya dude

@Lucidscience  Hey man can you DM me with instructions on how to find a team or create one,

Check the pinned messages!

Is there anywhere were I can find a team?
@Qi’ra ^
The Science Fair by Lucidscience
Battlefy is the simplest way to start, manage, and find esports tournaments | Create. Compete. Conquer.
Register yourself as a free agent, or look through the teams to see if there’s any open slots!
If we have enough free agents, they can all form into a team (:
I’m not sure how many we have right now, but definitely make an account and register now
the list of free agents is a little skewed as some are in a team but the team is still pending
we'll be needing a fourth captain for the next group of available free agents right now
I'm so happy at my team logo.
i nailed it
also if anyone is worried, look for an alternate for your team just in case!
good morning everybody!!!!!!!!!
🌞
I'd like to say that I'll be placing bets on  team KING'S ROW GODS to win kings row @roses
💦
LOL
its WET
i just made it
what a logo dude
should almost take kings row off the roster just cause your team is gonna dominate it so hard
If kings row goes i go Kappa
4real tho favorite map of all time
best map NA
But it's  in England.
Love losing 4 placements because of Widows and Genjis
ur mum's in england
🐟
I love leaving master 23 times and then dropping 300 SR
bruhh haha
you guys are br00tu1
Grazie
i love falling out of top 500 twice and then losing games in GM because of people just trying to enjoy the game playing Ana but actually throwing because shes the worst support pick right now
Why do people even still play Ana
Okay, I agreed with some of that, ana is still good if the ana player is good
if you watch ml7
its actually really messed up that no matter how good an Ana is, you still lose fights because of no rez and teammates getting out of Ana's line of sight for healing
yea that is true
@FireDragon ml7 is one of the few exceptions just because hes god tier with Ana, but he still loses because of this
I hate games that still want to run hanzo strat no matter what, or when sym came out again
yeah it is kind of a resident sleeper moment when its grav dragon combo to win every game haha
Welp I have a Diamond tank account and now a bronze dps account megaoof
should of gotten a fresh account instead of an account already in bronze
Hahahba
THE CLIMB
i got Diamond!
2-8
@Skeleton Yardel VERY nice dude!!!!
with just Soldier
Hey man, hitscan are making a comeback!!
Well
We're all soldiers now
It's my lucky dragons skin.
@Skeleton Yardel are you able to confirm your team on battlefy?
I'm sitting on the team roster skin, where now?
it should be somewhere within your team settings
Okay, think it's done
@Skeleton Yardel it is!! Good stuff dude!
ASS is our Rivals!
i can  explain
You're gonna get these 76 hands boi

i had the best come back today when i was stream. i got dc twice in one game the enemy team had 3:43 to our 1 and we 5:4 them
3:43 is hard to beat
minutes xD
could've given me more context. i need the context
well what game of overwatch goes for 3:43 score
you have a brian for a reason
if I get confused on how to play a game when I have 8000 hours on it, then you can tell that my brain is slow
but you know what was funny, 14k damage and 41 elms as rein both gold but what did i get instead for the end card
fuck 8:30 objective time card
not 4 golds
@Pivot
Oof, been there. done that.
am i a pussy if i call out of work because im too sunburned
No depends, did you get a sunburn so bad that it feels like needles when you were a shirt?
hmmmm not like that
i just mostly feel like i have the flu
WELCOME @Webby123 !!!!!!!
lucid do you play magic?
@Pivot i do not, although my roommate does! Why do you ask?

His harm is possible the summer games logo
from how it looks in the video
that looks so badass haha
ew, football.
That skin does look dope O.O
Yea I don’t like football unless we talking about futball or how it is spelled in spanish 😂
But the skin looks cool and it fits Reinhardt’s character
Plus the hammer is actually a trophy so i was wrong about the logo thing but still. You snack people with your victory trophy talk about a fuck you to the face
They also announced a new lucio ball map in that same tweet!!
Busan is a new South Korean arena that semi leaked a while back
And he says touchdown instead of hammer down. jk
That would be amazing tho
Work at blizzard
LOL
Ten bucks says he does though because the genji skins do a voice line change depending on the skin, mccree, and hanzo
English better?
& mercy in her witch skin has a different voice line
Sombra has some too
I never knew dis
Wahht
There’s also a zen one too
It’s common with the Halloween skins to have alternate voice lines
GRZ NGT
Overwatch - All Skin-specific Voiceline - April 2018 update
Here is a complete set of all Skin Specific voice lines as of April 2018. Because there is almost 30 heroes in Overwatch, there is a lot more voice actors. B...
A couple of these were just event voice lines but not skin specific
Still crazy how many there are lol
So you never heard mccree say It's high tide in his summer skin or hanzo have a different voice which says the wolf instead of the dragon?
oh definitely I just didn't know about the mercy and sombra ones and a lot of the rest that aren't as prevalent. I guess I'm more focused on putting kids in the durt than listening to voice lines. Only the ults I know are going to get my ass kicked
Spit on him
hahah i feel the same as Donna, i only know the ultimate voice lines because i know to look out for them in game xD thats really sweet th0
Spit on who now? Children? Heee heee
NOT THE CHILDREN!!!
YES THE CHILDREN!!!!!
🤔
meh
What does the spot on her face look like to y’all
A fidget spinner
I need various opinions this is important
it looks like a black hawk
the beak is on her wittle nose

Hey guys can you tell me what's wrong with this shirt
no
Look at Leafon and Jolton
You don't see anything wrong?
other than Leafon's pie piece should be green, no

That's it

I didn't notice until after I bought it
The only excuse I could think is that they both have yellow bodies but then i look at glacion and vaporion and I am was like no they fucked it up
they.....
That's missing a p

it still looks cool though
Yea
Still going to wear it

I need a coach
@Prospect
his best advice to me was just practice @Nuvalin
l A,
i am
@Dzurek
10 qps
Only widow
like 20 ults
@Zachary may have some advice...he's a very good widow
😃
Add me or hit me up if you need or want some training, I’ve got suggestions from what I have learned personally
@Nuvalin
Dude why TF is Biggby coffee so expensive 😭
What the fuqqq
Because they cash in off people's addictions and because every cup has 45 grams of sugar in it
HAHAHAHAHA
And because you still bought it
@Gillian dont use my server as a platform to market your sr boosting thanks
Hey guys, if you are involved in the science fair tournament, please take a look at the #announcements  and #the-science-fair text channels
😎 💦
I got that message too lol blocked
BRINGIN DOWN THE BAN-HAMMER
#B005T3DN00BZ
@Lucidscience undeafen nerd
@Dzurek i was gettin f00d
lmao
So, when is my team going, i i've in the UK and i got work, is it later tonight
Look at the announcements channel @Skeleton Yardel
You will probably be tentative for around 4:30-5pm EST
And if you dont care if your match is streamed or not, you can just play the game at 3pm EST
Please read the information first
i got it, done with work fo the day
i'm bready
Except half my team isn't even on discord
Get ahold of them through their battletags
none of them have battle net open either
Who isnt on discord thats on your team. Send their battletag
They most likely go by a different name and are in this discord.
Consider me a fill for any team that needs a player if I'm around. Any role
I'll be home in like 2 hours
i did the math, if the matches start at 8:00 tonight america, then that's about midnight in the UK
Thank you @Zeinder! Awesome
Project your match is not going to start that late
Your maths are quite off
well, it will be pretty late
Well I work at 5est (Will have to leave in ~3hours), and won't be back till probably 8:30-9. So that's my everything for today
My evening for tomorrow is pretty free though
Very nice dude
@Skeleton Yardel if you would rather play right at 3pm, you have to ask the other team captain and agree on it. Just know that the match wont be streamed
I;m okay with the time
alright!
just as long as my team is here 😬
remember to stay tuned in to the stream to get an idea for when your game starts!!!
I have the 2nd lowest SR on my team
send help
@Pivot where TF are you
@Skeleton Yardel @roses are both of your teams ready to go?
i thought we were 2nd reeee
wtf
@Ship what team are you?
REEEEFormed

Cosmic was

We had a roll call at 3 so we went up against Shadow
We didn't plan to play twice today so the teams already disbanded
wait @MapleReign
we are doing 3 games today
hello?
where is lucid

I'm pretty sure that was between this weekend and next
one per team each day, sat and sun
and then next week we finish?
That was my understanding? :u

Papa Lucid set us straight
rule 8 "Teams play 1 game on Saturday and 1 game Sunday"

❤
We're banning Genji next time
WHY DIDN'T YOU LOOOOL
:0

Reaper still best boy

😦
So, what are the score now?

git gud kiddo
Lest we didn't go 0-3
yeah haha at least nobody went 0-3 haha
😭
surprised there was no 2-1's today
i know right
tommorow some ez 3-0's for Shadow Juice though
Cosmic is still last though
cosmic is gone
ah
RIP
RIP
We got 3-0'd tho
First match
Y I K E S
then 2-1
you'll go 3-0 to you next
I'm so confused
What
YOU DON'T SUCK
Okay thanks
You guys put one hell of a fight as well
Was a very close match
Like the whole thing
we'd done no scrimming beforehand, just QP matches an hour before
King's Row was yikes but we were like NAH WE ARE THE KING'S ROW GODS AND THIS IS AN EZ CLAP
Same
i even said after the game "they are called kings row gods, we'll give them that"
So, if we are in 3rd, we can still win?
well 3rd out of 5, so you have a good chance
er
two teams are tied for 1st so far, you still have 3 more rounds to do before finals, plenty of chances to get more points
2 more rounds
3 including finals
Are the standings kinda scuffed lol
Or do I not understand them
Dzurek and Anal are tied for first
You're second
project is 3rd
add up results, not the P
the P is weird
I know we can do better
my nerves let my team down i feel
Everyone did great today
It was a great time!!!
❤ (3) 💦 Lucid5BigHuge
it's more personally
but, the feeling of a tournament is now burned into me, so expect a better show next time
but watching the kings row match back, i can see SO many mistakes i made
sall good brah
Finally got back to masters
for the 24th time XD
I've almost got all 3 accounts in plat
Dps account is last one... and man it's hard...
I have to become those salty people who instalock dps and not switch
because i don't wanna play anything else...
Very noicee
I know the plat life all too well man
Yeah it's where u naturally belong
@Lucidscience
Plat chat
Kabji's aim guide is pain on the wrist and fingers XD
Luuul
Any know how to do tracer 180 flick properly, I get like 170 flinks XD
Dude i just got the big boy blowouts this afternoon straight scuffed as all hell
Actually cannot move
who's playing first today?
Wait what happened?
oof
i would like t not go up against KRG again
Lucid shit his pants
LIVE
OH shit XD
for real?
Oh btw if you guys want to watch Batman Gotham by Gaslight is really good
no dude wtf hahahaha
@Trashmankind xD
omegalul
Why has everyone just left all the teams
@Skeleton Yardel they havent, some people just cant play because of things they have going on during the weekend
i messaged @Webby123 , hopefully he replies soon
i just talked to him
@Skeleton Yardel pencil isnt gonna be here?
feelsbad
i know right, we got Webby
ight
Seems cool
im just listening to music about to get on
Just waiting on Cookie now
ight
@Skeleton Yardel @MapleReign SENDING INVITES NOW
@everyone we need a sub
dps player
i'd say ask @Pivot  but he probably won't respond in time
Can you
we need someone at this point
what type of dps do you need?
Any dps
im the 7th of reeformed, if you need me I can
mostly hitscan
COme here my boi
Pivot showed up 10 minutes late to the first game yesterday i highly doubt he'll show up right now
send me your battle tag
@Dzurek @Ship invites are being sent now
GOODLUCK!
Lucid want a co-caster XD
Haha next round!
gg's @Ship
ggs
i wish we put up a better fight the first two rounds but
baby rage op
are you guys a new team
yes sir
WELCOME @Grey Nalasan @Polarized @Moffsie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
💪
I feel like when i told them that i'm really strict that they took it for granted
hence why kiz and pivot both got kicked
i didnt get spectated enough 😡
@Ship i tried my best dude haha
GIVE ME ATTENTION
lol
Next time you run a tourney let me know 😃 would love to join in the fun
🤔
@Grey Nalasan what you play? (role wise)
I'm a flex player i will play whatever
I gotchu
but i prefer tanks/heals
how is it that i go from terrible in a tournament, to brilliant in solo q
We'll just have to come back next week harder than before
and maybe, with some luck, we might have a shot
@Skeleton Yardel the difference between comp and Tourney comp is like comparing Mars to Venus
I was wondering why my computer was going so slow
turns out it likes to do Security checks without telling me
Typical Windows 10 shit hahah
i still have windows 7
never updated
Ohhh
still won 3 comp games though
You can turn automatic updates off in settings
nah, it's better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.
And windows defender , which is probably what was doing the security check
Iant to play Wow, but i want to get my SR up
hmmmm
@Skeleton Yardel with only 3 1/2 hours until BfA im right with you
I'm still training an alt Pandarian
well if you need help hmu
I'm still on the turtle
🐢🐢🐢
im trying to get some OW games in before this expansion drops but noone is playing lol
Has BFA dropped?
Its tonight i thinkk
Depends on your timezone
Toimezones always mess us up here
it drops in 12 minutes
@Skeleton Yardel
3pm west coat 6pm east
coast*
This panda is ready
actually massive
The setup at my new apartment is righteous
nice 😃
GG
new setup
@Lucidscience
@Pastaax umm no chain?! #hogprobs #fixhook
TFW you get 1st place 5 times in a row in FFA as Reaper, but get shat on by a guy called Krillin
anyone know RxSlaker? He seems to have disappeared from my group chat as well as the community discords
Lol? @Skeleton Yardel
I'll see if he's still on my Overwatch friends list @Dzurek
thanks @Cass
Hmm no rxslacker?
he kinda just disappeared was about to do some stuff with him tonight... And the  he disappeared from my discord my friends list and the group chat
@Dzurek practice tonight?
Thats kind of a sign @Dzurek dzhahaha
I was going to do it @Grey Nalasan but now I gotta find a off healer...
Maybe he just didnt want to play anymore... 😕
well i can off heal since im flex if you want to find a new mt
Maybe, but why would he remove everyone and leave all the discords?
Hmmm
Hard to say man
What if he died and the fbi auto removed him
uh, what?
I mean, at least man up and say "hey, I'm out"
I just want to play in the tournament, every team i join or try to sub for ends up replacing me
lol
isn't that what subbing is?
substituting is just temporally replacement, right?
smh
Well if you go for @Dzurek team then you'd only need 2 more ppl lol @Grey Nalasan
Isn't being on a team mean that you don't go rage quiting in the middle of a tourney
Goteem
@Trashmankind he was included when i said 3
Ohh
Dang
That's why we are Forfeiting and i'm joining Cass's team
already talked with them
👍
BRUHHH
and I know @Zeinder is a good friend of Grey so i'm sure they could pick him up
its that a thing haha
what the hell is going on lol
None of your business @Lucidscience
im in the middle of a tryout right now and i see all this
GG
GG EZ PZ
@Lucidscience I have a Me Grey and Trak and thats it, Rx left randomly Jony is busy Hornet isn't off work in time
ahh okay
I mean you’ve got me too I told you I’m home
@Qi’ra 😂
Ez pz lemon squeezee
yea but we won't have any practice with you
it would be almost as bad as it was when we threw Pilot into the the last mess
if there are any issues with teams right now please pm me
Well I can't play saturday now
Bruh
Bro I only got thew warning yesterday and didn't even do shit
Yo wtf did you do to get the ban hammer that hard hahhaa
NOTHING
All I know is two games yesterday where it would be deserved

my other 10 games I didn't even say shit too any and only did calls
Jeff dont mess around dude haha

so now my sr is going to drop even more because I am on vaction the day before
GG
I LOVE BLIZZARD
Press F
to pay respects to FireDragon

Dzurek got me the hook up so I will be able to play saturday
MVP @Dzurek
I mean i have 4 accounts for a reason lmao
and i've reported ALL of them >:)
xD
on the plus side, i went from 2900 to 3200 today
Nice idk if i'll play ow today
promised some friends to play r6
I am going from 3463 to 3000 by the time I come back
rip
yep
and it was a bitch to go from 3200 to 3463
i honestly think i'm gunna play my dps account and play sombra
cuz she is broken
Yera I am now considering to get a new account at this point
i forgot how fun Brig was
I can't play brig
like i'm to aggressive with her
I have been think it for a while because I want to see my new fresh rank after playing 5 season of improvement and get away from shit toxic teammates but now this just takes icing on the cake
brig is more intuitive than mechanical for me, ive always loved playing her and relying on hunches and heat-of-the moment combos to make good plays
also the peel is reel
Well guys I never want it to happened but I got to start streaming fortnite
make sure to include roblox fortnie mods
Fartnite incoming
F                 A                     R                        T

@everyone what looks crazy a normal t-shirt with comic or anime design on it or a shirt ment to look like it is inside out
huh?
i'm also confused
You heard me
I am tlaking about any shirt that is like a charamander shirt or a spidey shirt
it depends on your taste. don't ask others because it'll just lead to mix messages
Not leading shit I am just asking like if you saw someone wear those kids of shirts who would you call crazy
both
no both one or the other
this is one or the other not fucking both
i don't like either on kids
not a kid
then...
Does anyone have Mitsuki battle.nat name and number, only one i'm missing
hmm, i'd say comic.
sorry @Skeleton Yardel i do not
it's okay, Lucid has it
I can't wait to see what new teams come in the future
i got yew
The future is bright ☀ 😎

HUGE STREAM OPENING 10,000 LOOT
Omg hahaha
So i think i might of solved my streaming problem! 😄
or at least i i hope i did lol
@g_rantkillinit very nice dude!
what was wrong??
If you have any questions regarding OBS setup , @Zeinder is really good with it
I was just lagging throughout my streams :/ i wasn't  sure as to what was the cause for it
hmm
if your still having issues, we could go through some of your settings one of these days
i can also help with stream setup
but my laptop is pretty old and can't really handle streaming that much. Maybe it is in the settings of obs, but im pretty sure i have the settings correct for the laptop i have
right on!
When do you think the next Science Fair will be?
dont you love when your internet crashes while you were in the middle of a game winning push and lose 50 fucking sr because of it
been there, hate that

@Lucidscience idk how does one react to be calling poko in comp games?
not even jokin got on the team of a 5 stack twice and the rein player kept askin me if i was a poko smurf...
I don't even know much about poko other than man had some really good d.va bombs
you could either play along with it, or you could just be like "Nah dude, some people call me big D though... big Dzurek"
In other news, my fucking refrigerator that i moved into leaks water and destroys my food
Big yikes

and people are being pretty positive for the most part
@Skeleton Yardel what stream haha?

Im close i can taste it!
@Moon no problem my dude !!! Im happy to help out as i appreciate the support myself!!

@Dzurek oh haha i thought he was mentioning something else we were talking about earlier
@everyone
Wad up brothers and sisters!!
Just hope my attempts at making the streams more popular doesn't backfire on me
@Skeleton Yardel how would it backfire on you lol
@cloudconnect WUD UP DUDE
@Lucidscience itll backfire when they discover he didn't win mvp
trolls appearing in the chat
ohh hahaha
honestly havent had too much of that thank goodness lol
other than the usual trolls 😉
there was some dude named icewallowcome that would show up and troll chat but its been a minute xD
if i had a name like, i'd just go around donating
well thats the thing haha he/she would drop some bits to get the streamer (me) to say his name...
and if you sound it out... well, it doesnt sound too good hahahaha
Yo remember the ice poseidon fan kid that was requesting inappropriate songs lmao
I think his name was cxinthechat or something equally cringe
wait IcePoseiDon?
@Cass ^
Yeaaaah @Cass i do hahahhaa that was so annoying lol
Yeah the guy who's perma banned on twitch @Dzurek
Have a good day off dude @Lucidscience
😁
I used to know that guy
Frickin cxinthechat hahahaha😂😂
Thanks my dude @DylanMullaney !!🙏🏼
@Lucidscience I built a stand for my "webcam" (phone) and ordered some new lights and an actual green screen. Should get here next week so you can see what I have to put up with in my games
Oof
Back to my old sens from like 8 months ago though. Low sens sucks, high sens is where it's at. 6.3@1000
We need like a world cup viewing party in discord in like 1hr 40m
Hmm, error starting game. I think a short break is in order
Hahahha dude im at like 4 sense @ 800 right now xD
I whip my mouse around especially as winston
I like to be able to do easy 180s. That genji on the other team doesn't like me doing that. 180 ulting genji sleeps are the best
Gonna chill in the  OW channel if anyone gets bored
I would be hangin but im afk/out of town right now im just typin from my phone haha!!
Dude what did you think about the world cup game of usa vs canada though?
Also p.s. @Zeinder ive been flexing onto Ana lately when someone hard locks main tank and i cant play it haha. You would actually be proud
I was popping off as Ana the last time i played Lijiang Tower xD
Ana is harder than people give credit for
You spend a lot of time just trying to not die to flankers
The easiest games are when people help you
As for USA vs Canada. Fuck you xQc, get rolled and smoked my doggie
I have the hardest time dealing with tracers as Ana for whatever reason. Dude i had a brigitte on my team and she was legit trying to tank when she couldve stayed by me and stunned the tracer even after i was screaming at her hahah
You could have my life, have part of the routing commit suicide, DC, and have to turn a VPN on to reconnect
just snap your arm in half with your flick XD
So everything related to me playing blizzard games is fucked. I got put on a server in chile just now
200ms Ana is not fun.
We did win though
lmao
I got DC'd as we won, and still got SR
I call that a victory.
Dude wtfff hahahha
Thats br00tu1
I'm going to drop DDWRT onto my router since I need to wait out the instability

He also hit another give too
lmao
Hit another give @FireDragon ? 😂
guy*
Ohhh hahahah
"I smell bacon"
🐖🐖🐖
lol XD
I am not usually rude to cops, but in this cause I wish I asked him for his badge number XD
I feel like a typically weird college student who is against cops XD
I think it's fair to at least be anti "guy that nearly hit me when I had right of way as a pedestrian" lmao
honestly though hgahah
Fuck the police I support you @FireDragon
@Qi’ra 😂 😂 😂
I almost got arrested on campus once for doing a fucking English project
Like I am truly appalled
whuutt
Lol yeah we had to make a display for our writing piece about the surrounding area and I put mine by the police station on campus and they were like nah that’s vandalism but I didn’t even tape it I just set it next to it to take a picture for my project lol
damn thats ruthless hahah
what a joke forreal

WELCOME @Rick Sanchez !!!
Ay wad up boi's
What team was Maplereign part of?
He was on Weeb Squad
alright
i've seen something interesting in their teamplay
Courtesy of shadow juice
?
Can't give away our tactics i'm afraid
i see a chink in your armour
ruh rohh
Stirring the pot I see
As the captain of the "champions" it falls on me to be the leader my team deserves
that means watching the old matches tons of times
Yea we have no teamplay XD
It is  literally just when you que for competitive
Wow it's almost as if, I threw a bunch of people to play casually so lucid could have a team for his tournament 🤔
👀
XD
Y'all are more than welcome to move on and make your own team to try hard  :3c
💕
No I was doing it because I felt like I was being too toxic for the team because I was try haarding
Season 1 was a test the waters
I don't even see us as official champions, more like "hey, we showed this can work and teams can win"
boobles is the true champ
I semi did the same
I got a lot of my friends together but a lot of my friends were hardcore players
other than 1 rage quitter and 1 guy never showing up on time
and 1 person having school problems
yeah it will be more structured next time around haha
it was a ton of fun thoo
Jacob Saldana
Winston's OH YEAH
OH YEAH
And then for season three I my make my own team
xxDD
there are so many people who throw in high masters right before gm
its f'ed up man
im talking 3900+
3900-4000
Yea or you get uncordinated teams
i just had a duo queue torb/sym
the next game i have to solo heal ana
and the last one before i rage quit, i had a duo queue tracer/doomfist who werent doing anything
we had quad dps
its almost like people dont care if they win ..
lol
Yep that's how I feel sometimes too
That's why I played on my plat account but that is just fucking worst
I had one game were the team said let's counter tracer, but when we get the counters they don't focus tracer
and then the whole match they said the tracer was a smurf
thats simply people not knowing how to counter tracer xD
big yikes lol
They picked mccree and sombra
XD
damn,,
and they didn't counter the doomfist
which both dove on me in the backline
I'm slowing going from Reaper to 76
but mccree and sombra where battling the solo tank Zarya
yeah thats pretty bad hahahah
its Overwatch Horror story hour, please enlighten us on your Overwatch Horror Story @everyone
I forgot i bought Shanghai 76
why?
xDDD
One time I lost. I was horrified.
I had a widow main who left voice chat because I asked her to "switch off widow to reaper pls, you are doing fine but we need more front line damage"
she then typed in chat know your carry bitch, stay in your rank
One cold night on kings row, we went up against a really good Genji called Krillin
i still have nightmares
I lost to.. a... a..a..a meme comp of 6 dps when I was low plat player 😢
OOOF
I fear to this day a reaper, genji, sombra, soldier, widow, tracer, and mei comp
what a mix hahaha
I know right XD
full meme comp
sombra and soldier where the supports
mei and reaper where tanks
and widow tracer was dps
Question
will we see Busan take over Lijiang tower
or will it be 3 new maps
i have yet to decide!!
I feel like im going to end up creating a google form for questions like that
I really do like Busan though
ive been happy with Rialto and Busan
Devs have been doing well on map design
Just no Junkertown or horizon
i really don't want to go 6 tp 6
i respect that hahah
Kings row gods are our Rivals
Cosmic has the highest SR, but KRG has the best teamwork
Shadow Juice had good teamwork when i didn't change roaster ever week
due to ... issues
I was hoping to go up against you at some point
But murder isn't allowed
Yea well pivot didn't show up in time and so i replaced him, Kiz straight up rage quit in the middle of the game so i was completely done with him Keeks had to dip out cuz evac of Cali, Jony had to dip on the last day due to school
We had the same problem with Jingle
which one?
lol there are 4 different reason
He just didn't turn up
I love how you are talking but you had so many fill in who were high rank
yeah
that's why i don't see us as the "champions"
oh okay
it was all over the place, but it gonna be like that for the first season
Thank you for the positive encouraging comments I’m glad you all enjoyed the science fair
Mvp match was so fun though 😃
The mvp match vod was so great to watch 😛
I wish working retail wasn't literal dicks so I could have been there 😭
BOOBLES!
Im going to put out a google form that will have dates and whatever days are more popular we will roll with for hopefully little to no schedule conflicts 😛
Sundays will be hard for me because tespa tournament are sundat
ahh okay!
well its most likely going to be on Saturday/Sunday, because thats when most people have the day off
just a matter of dates

@Qi’ra are you serious haha? For what reason?
😮
No lol i didnt but he was an obnoxious backseat gamer anyways \_(ツ)_/¯
Ohhh hahaha😂
Yeah i would tend to agree
Whatchyall need is a passenger seat gamer
eyyyy
😛
LETS GO DUDE
Anyone want my account
I give up on overwatch
it is a shit game
How many junkrat hours does it have
I don't know and don't care. If a game has players who blame the guy who leaves a toxic chat for a lost over the zen and sym who did shit all game then I don't want the game anymore
I want my $41.60 back
I could take it. Would be fun playing comp on it.
@FireDragon dont let it ruin your game brother, i had a rough day today because of shitties in my games too. Its just how it is
I know but lately I have been more stressed I guess and I think the annoying assholes was making worst
Yeah i feel the same man
I always get super stressed when school starts back up again
Its gonna take me a little bit to find a good balance again with the new schedule
rip
Rest in peace
Goodnight errybody 💤💤
night
Apparently I lose every game I heal in, and I don't understand why.
U no good heal. Me good heal >:)
You good commentator
You were always born to be our dps main, you know it's true zeinder
Thing is, I won every game I DPS'd
EXACTLY
So either I'm a bad healer, or most DPS are bad.
@Zeinder most dps are bad
frag whores that dont have any game awareness or know how to play with a team
thats the problem ive been having lately with climbing in mid-high masters
exactly that
Well, also there's the fact that I can call something out when healing and noone responds. As DPS I can just do it my damn self.
I'm the worst DPS
GODS OF OVERWATCH BESTOW SOME SR UPON THEEEE
Welcome back @Z3R∅ loool
i was cleaning dc servers and some other also got left by mistake
sall good mann
Torbjorn rework hype!
ESKETITTT
@Skeleton Yardel Torb main incoming?¿°¿
XD
big X D in the chat lloooll
I like the new torb and phara
Yeaah dude for sure°
Im excited for torb hahahha
@Lucidscience  verywell maybe
we'll see how he play, if we can squeeze him in the 2nd season even
Mvp season 2 wins via torb jisming on enemies
@torb
lol
Boobles will win with Torb
Press q to splooge
hahahaha
honestly though
have you seen the Bug with Torbjorn?
I am a torb main comfirmed
a lot of people want this pushed to live, even if it's just player view only
but it works with all Heroes, so if you have, let's say "Dynasty Mei" then her primary and Wall will be gold yellow

Aimbot.com
I didnt actually mean for that to be a link haha
oh god
The fact he Accused you of using a ver specific site Actually wild
Sounds like he's familiar with aimbotting 👀
I don't know what Xaim is even, hold on
Yeah takes one to know one😂 especially when he rips the name bomb..
okay, so you need to buy it
why would i ever do that
I feel like making something in my modeling program. What should I make?
How much time do you have?
Around 6 hours.
I dunno
Tracer "Timejumper" fan skin, Enji Yamakuza

Hmmm, I can try. Never made a gun before, especially pulse pistols.

I just saw this I thought it would be the best skin for reaper, he already does the arms cross thing and is a half dead person
nah, don't you see, it's a fan made skin so the devs ignore it.
I know it is a fan made but i still think it should be a skin
Just like the genji magician skin

yes thats @ me
Big Renj
@Lucidscience how would like to be my school's coach for our team XD
@FireDragon I would honestly be down hahah
For real? damn didn't expect that low key XD, my team say they are down but they aren't follow set on the idea
yeah i would have to find a time when i could review like vods or scrims
but it could be doable
and maybe even provide some content
We are going to have one scrim today so I will livestream it for review later
i could use like visor so we could get into x's and o's , technical shit
if thats what you really wanted
we'll see
Yea true
Thanks man you are honestly the best
hahah no problem man
this community is awesome
i hope to keep it that way
We're alright
its like people actually care about each other xD
Don't worry I know you wil

HAPPY FRIDAY EVERYONE!!!!!!
HAPPY FRIDAY!!!!!!🙏🏼😊
I slept in gg
Sorry to hear project 😦
i got pizza
i'm better now
Nicee dude , pizza heals the soul
Turns out my assistant manager decided to bail out of a 8 hour shift after doing only 3 hours
leaving me with the 5, that i shouldn't have to do to begin with
its all good man
i cant wait for the Halloween eventtt
it'll probably be shit like the past 2 events
@Lucidscience ITS GONNA BE HUUUGE
@Lucidscience it's gunna be awesome. Blizzard has tons of good events i wouldn't imagine this one being any worse than before
Reparative is one word but not bad lmao anyone who thinks that is just a moron
🤪🤪🤪
@Rubii remember the comment of if you have nothing nice to say to say it at all?
🙏 😉 (2)
I know lucid has said something as a mod lets say just say don't let it happen again
I personally don't care for the summer event cause i dont like lucio ball but the halloween mode is always p fun
also i'm mostly excited for the skins
yeaah haha Halloween is usually pretty solid
i like sombra's demon hunter skin thoo forreal
i know its not really halloween , but its dopppe
it's pretty fuckin Pog
Hopefully Brig gets like, an actual good skin
There is talk of maybe a different knight skin for either her or rein
yeaaah i want a sweet Brig skin tooo
a halloween Rein skin would be MASSIVE DOE
Give,,, Moira,,, a,,, good,,, skin,,,,
BUT BLACKWATCH MOIRA
HOT LESBIAN SPAGHETTI
OKAY YEAH
BUT SHE DESERVES MORE THAN ONE
All I want is a spooky sombra
TRUE THO
She deserves all the skins 😤
yo @Lucidscience do you think if i wait till the event before claiming my gold boxes from the poptarts it will give me good skins?
as long as i dont put them onto my accoubt till the event is live right?
Hmmm i think that might be possible
Cause when they first introduced the golden was at the first anniversary event right? And I remember a lot of people getting anniversary skins
But then it also makes me think that blizzard also sets the code for the golden loot boxes to be the same as regular just produce a 100% chance for a legendary
I’ve heard people say that you can use them for the event
I feel like you can do that @Dzurek
Ive never tried before but i dont see why it wouldnt work!
@FireDragon might be right though, they might keep the golden loot boxes the same as regular with the garaunteed legendary
Just went 5/4 victory on junkertown, oh man, that game had me sweating.
BRINGING THE SWEAATTT
never played Tracer so hard
I just talked to Nomy from SF shock haha

ACTUALLY EDITED
@everyone https://www.twitch.tv/lucidscience
Lucidscience - Twitch
THE MASTERS BACKPACK (climbing with a sore back)
Twitch isn't letting me continue subbing to lucid because it wasn't a free sub
Waaaat
See I have to pay
I can't just continue throw free sub
Was it through prime sub?
The sub was gifted by lucid
It probably expired?
Like I said in my first comment
No it says continue
my twitch prime isn't expired either because I can resub to xqc and guac
Maybe @Cass or @Dzurek can help?? They probably know more about twitch than me lol
You had to have done the $1 thing in Subtember
It's October now so rip
😦 @FireDragon
Unless you just mean in general
Gift subs are a 1 month thing
He'd have to either gift you another month or you'd have to pay $5
if you wanted to continue it
I am trying to continue with free subs with twitch prime
Oh rip
then I will wait for it to expire then I will use my twitch prime
You can't resub with Prime
Ye ye
You gotta wait till it's done
Hi sorry whats up?
@FireDragon if you have used your prime sub on someone else you need to wait till that prime sub is over to send it to lucid
I haven't
He just has to wait for his Lucid one to run out
Thanks for figuring it out guys!!!
I believe that should work honestly I've got no clue why it is happening. I'm assuming the classic refresh the page and restarting your browser page didnt fix it
The thing is with twitch prime it won't auto renew your sub and you can't preemptively use it before say a gift sub runs out
twitch prime subs are completely manual it's kinda weird

FUCKING GARBAGE OF A GAME
@FireDragon oh no what happened haha?!
The server discount with no problems
Disconnect?
Yes
I am in another match on my alt
Ahh man, thats a feelsbadman moment
Yep, I complained about this before saying that either the grace period needs to be longer than 10 seconds because I got back in the game before the countdown hit but it was too late  or even don't take away sr from people who get server disconnect which isn't hard to detect the difference between leaving and get force disconnection
I feel like if ur not in by the time the match has started you should be fine
wow i worded that poorly
If you load in before the match actually begins then you should be fine but if your not in before that you should get the sr lost
@Lucidscience if you get BO4 make sure to play Rush Zombie mode first thing 😄
Yea but if you have good connection and png and you get server disconnected how is it your fault, the 50 sr is more so for people who purposely leave to case a 5 v 6
it's a shame my skin was never noticed by the devs, but whatever
Rip
I accidentally join the wrong chat when i was trying to look at lucid’s and i thought i missed a lot of messages because every chat there had a notification
@FireDragon I mean I agree but how do they set up a system to tell if they left to throw and not because they dc'ed because there have been times that someone has dc'ed but just decided not to come back.
Yea that is a good point too
then at that point if you haven't join back the I would say the sr lose is fair
which would be at the beginning of the match that gives you roughly 1-2minutes
Yea
There should be a way to tell if somebody intentionally left the game through different forms of input (clicking exit game or closing the application) or left the game due to network issues/outages. Obviously people would be able to get around that by pulling the plug on their router/modem , but atleast it will cut down on the unnecessary SR loss due to in-game bugs , or ISP problems
Yea exactly because if the game can detect a server disconnect it should be able to realize that it was that, also if someone was moving around will prove it
WELCOME @IcedSoyBoi !!!!!
Thank
You're
Can someone tell me how to make a channel?
Like a YouTube channel or twitch or discord
Twitch.
Well it would come down to one having a twitch, setting up your description (just making it neater like talking about things you want your audience want to know about you and your channel, and other ways to interact with you), background for your channel is up to you really, and come up with a descent stream schedule or something similar to one
Software to use: obs or streamlabs. I would recommend streamlabs to got overlays easier and widgets
I would help more but i got to sleep
@Nuvalin you also need to be I believe at least 16 to stream
Well rip.
I am a bloody diamond 3-4 game away from master.
And I am 11
@Dzurek
yea Turtle legally you are not allowed to stream
I may be wrong with the age but you need to check that before doing anything with twitch and youtube
Ok so you have to be at least 13
Yea buuuutttt, so long as you don’t mention your age 🤔
@Nuvalin the rules are in place to keep you safe along with your audience. Lying about your age isn’t safe for both parties involved and when it comes down to legal stuff, it can get pretty messy.
As a self proclaimed Mom of the general public, I’d tell you to wait until you’re 13
And good luck with getting to gm!!
I will listen to valkryie. Sorry,
❤
@FireDragon it makes you sign a something saying you are 13 and if they find out you can be sued money
It also probably has something to do with labor laws I'd imagine
Since when you apply for affiliate they have you sign a w2
Lol @Zeinder
If that's how im gonna be treated in vc!!
@Trashmankind TRASHYYYYY
im back lul
R Yall colon

@Trashmankind i used to play vain with the pro vain players 2-3 years ago
pro vain players haha like druid and gabe?? I played right when it came out and was in the top guild for a season! It's been a year though and a ton of new heroes, I got the beta for 5v5 which was cool
hard to find people who play it tho
I miss rumblysueperset though, I loved watching his streams
You remember the nerds guild?
no was that an actual guild name?
mine was We2Sexy, we were like one of the first guilds to max the level the first season it came out
what did you play?
Everyone always beats me to welcoming new people PepeHands

Ello
@Lucidscience when is the tournament today? Because if it is now i will need a later match because i am at the dentist
Matches start at 6pm EST
Okay coolio
Welcome to the server @feuef !
thanks ^^
I was looking for the tournament, but it's for NA right?
Yes it is on NA
but anyone is welcome, shouldn’t be much lag in custom games really
Mb, it wasn't writed
You think?
I thought it was something like 200ms
No worries! I think we have a few others who are outside NA that have joined
Generally in custom games the MS isn’t as high
Ok, so I will try ^^
And the most recent patch has reduced MS for some people
I didn't notice that, thx ^^
Of course! 😀♥️
Hello @feuef !! 😎
Hey
You guys excited for the tourny later today?!
Yeah
yes!!
It should be entertaining to say the least haha!
😄
@Lucidscience 41 people entered now lmao
BRIG DEFENDERS WERE LIKE
“Just adapt and stop whining”
How ironic that the tables have turned…
Hahahaha 😈😈
Is it me or are the colors for content creator changed 🤔
Oh wait were is my sub thing i just realized
Content creators have been purple for a while! Make sure your discord and twitch are linked, and that your sub hasn’t lapsed if you’re not sure why it’s gone! @FireDragon
Yea i think my twitch prime ran out today
So i will just renew it when i get home today
The sub not the account
I am just used to being yellow
Welcome to the discord!  @SixthSith ❗️❗️❗️
Thanks!
The scariest thought i'm currently having is that all the guys who i promoted the tournament to, couldn't find the Discord
You might not have been able to give them a permanent link, so it could have expired before they used it to join
@Skeleton Yardel you should be able to invite people to the Discord if they are having troubles!
i've had no one ask me about a discord, so i can only hope they found it
Welcome @Hunts ❣️
What's good?
alright so what do i do when the time comes lol
@roses Read the critical rules on the tournament webpage!
it's not seeded?
just seeded

okay. maybe not all the old days
i miss bayblade reaper 😦 aka first gen ana
I miss when her ult gave move speed that shit was funny
But I do like that her ult heals now
yeahhh it's nice to be able to use to to save people as an alternative to only using to combo with someone
MEGA ZOOM
more tools in the kit
u s e f u l
allow ana to swap speed with heal
1
qqqqqqq
yes
I think they should change brig ult, keep armor the same but brig gets no armor from it & up the speed boost she gets slightly
to balance this, give brig 200 damage with shield bash
Slightly speedy
WHAT
no like
it damages herself
Yes
Brig pops ult she dies
she has to weigh the odds, kill myself or stun the enemy
Hmmmmmmm
because now the stun lasts 10 seconds
but you can still wiggle a little for balance purposes
Slight wiggle allowed
also they need to have persistent dead bodies
so you can strategically kill yourself to build a wall
Kill everyone outside enemy spawn
They can’t leave
well they have to dig
torb hammer replaced with shovel
New character dig ability?
They can attack by hitting people over the head with it
new dog hero confirmed
digs for bones
also digs through bodies
DOG CHARACTER YES
enemy can be hypnotized into petting
but so can allies for balance
must fetch or health drops over time
If you kill him you lose 100hp for hurting doggo
can't capture point because dog
but he can capture *you*
He attaches onto your leg and slowly drains your health, must pet him to let go
tail wags when on fire
unlockable golden bone and dog tag
he's naturally the least sneaky hero, leaves paw prints everywhere and pants
E ability is bark
no cooldown
BORK BORK BORK
if you sync your barks with your tail wags they become sonic barks and can boop enemy
also you dont actually have to control him with WASD, he just kinda goes wherever
Ideal for track pad players
😂 😂 😂
im a track pad player chill 😦
Bullying track pad players will NOT be tolerated
the hell did i just read
a dog hero with no scoot your butt on the ground ability is BIG WHIFF
TRACK PAD SUPREME @js 😂😂
lol track pads
i wanna try one
i think pro strat is using a magic trackpad, they're huge and pressure sensitive, gg ez

junkrat one trick lel
6 man tires nothing more nothing less
"TO BE FAIR YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PRETTY HIGH IQ TO PLAY JUNKRAT" - @roses
Season 1 I could get a 6 man easy! 5 enemies + myself
yes
Thanks buddy
xD
Well, to be fair you have to have a pretty high IQ to play Junkrat. The intuition required to fire perfect prediction shots is well beyond the analytical and purely mechanical skill required by hitscans and other aim based heroes.
The trap is also one of the most intelligent abilities, requiring what appears to be spam, but is actually calculated to snare charging Reins and tired Pharahs.
Total mayhem is additionally one of the most difficult passives to master in the game, and if pulled off can both increase your already high IQ, and wipe an entire team via the ancient art of kamikaze.
And don't get me started on the mines
Highest skill ceiling ability in the game
And WE SAW A TEAM WIPE VIA TOTAL MAYHEM just a few weeks ago lol

Nice bro
Aptyx is looking to shoot for playoffs next OD. When does the new season start anyhow?
May
Sometime
Im surprised we did better than Calamity through the season
So like 15 weeks
Ye they sont have the synergy that they used to
Thats unlucky, you think they will stay together?
Idk I’ve heard two people say they might look for another
Team
It’s up in the air at this point
Yeah thats rough. I truly would have liked to see those guys make it, regardless of the past
Ye
I would have loved to stay on the team but other stuff happens and I’m doing better now than before
Looks like you are too
Yeah for sure haha
The new team has a big outlook, lots of room to grow and improve
Hopefully we will scrim you guys in the future for good practice
Ye that would be pog
Lately we have been looking for really good teams cause we kinda shit on 4.3’s but we get rolled by amazing teams like Alpha gaming and it feels horrible
Yeah i totally got you, what do you do at that point haha? Try and find scrims against like dogmen, mirage, alpha gaming, ATG, etc?
We played against alpha gaming in AG weekly and got blown out lol
We didnt actually have our full roster though, we were down 2 players
Ye alpha gaming is super dominant
Way better than Beta Gaming
🐡 (4)
Or even omega gaming..

It is really good
I like the tank but not how you cannot shoot out of his shield. I literally sent a air strike on myself
the only one who can defeat you is yourself #mvp
You are your own worst enemy
A.k.a my shield
It isn’t like overwatch where you can shot out of it
It blocks everything inside and ouy

Mobilize alongside the combat medic who made the shrewd decision to make the world a better place, one bandage... or bullet at a time: Baptiste. Begin your w...
NEW HERO LETSSSS GOOOOOOOO
Dude I'm so hype for new guy 👀
Also I fucking love his voice 😍
Sooo UBERR
New hero out now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Baptiste - Overwatch
An elite combat medic armed with an arsenal of experimental healing devices.
Goodbye sombra I main Baptiste now
THIS DUDE IS INSANE
FASHDFJKASFHAG
the new Ana lol
Gonna be WILD
honestly rip Ana
hes like an Ana/Zen mix
Sym barrier for DPS
BUT NEW DEFENSIVE ULT
we happy boys
And a fucknig immortaility field
ana mixed with zen mixed with symmetra xD
And lucio
yesss
His little ally amp it up heal
he has high mobility as well 😮
Wild as hell
He has it all
crouch jump HIGH AF
B I G
J U M P
Baptiste meta incoming
It looks like he has a huge hit box tho
yeaah this is true
As long as Goats dies, i'm in
Same
def a bigger hero haha
kill goats
as far as supports are concerned
I'm interested to see how Cookie or Jingle will be on them for season 2
Jingle!
@cookie
@Deleted User
there are two cookies hahahaha
We got all the cookies
its all about the cookies
hero is so good
HOW DID I HIT GENJI?
😅 😅
He's going to empower goats... lmao
as a support main, I'm not happy, but I'm excited to play his ass.
❤
He just makes goats better now
😦 (2)
Lol
for real 😦
Literally just replace zen
and it's goats comp 2.0
If you put Ana with him he is insane
He can even take a dps slot in 2-2-2
I'm calling it
You get anti and insane heals with bio nade and the ult
Who needs a defensive ult when we have invul
Exactly
Blocks a whole dva combo
They need to make the invul last for 4/5 seconds instead
and reduce the health to 200
tbh
Yeah 250 is too@much
Yeah, I was like that's a whole reaper lol
Sombra meta ;D
I love love love his kit though, I haven't even tried him, but on paper, it sounds really powerful. Idk how it will play out in my comp games though
The only thing I'm not a fan of is his burst shot
Not because burst shot is bad but because I am lmao
LMFAOOOO I'm deceased
I love his burst shot, but tbh  ithink it shouldhave been for a dps
a burst dps would be a really nice twist
my mercy playing ass just wasn't prepared :markasSob:
Mercy got nerfed 😃
again 😃
I love it 😃

Mvp is RIGGED
Now i've gotta step up and try, can't let Lucid leave me in the dust
Try what
An od team?
Going pro
Go for it dude, it just takes consistent commitment
Gotta get into masters first
game over
nande though
wait
what does that even mean lmfao
I thought it did way more than that
I am confusion
Sorry I'm a flex support player
there's weird calculations with his stuff. There's direct damage, impact, etc. Like like now a direct hit is 120 dmg, which I believe is the original 40 impact damage + max splash damage which is 80.
So if they boost impact to 60, getting hit in the face will do 140 damage
This also means a nano boosted grenade can one shot a 200hp hero
This ALSO means he can two shot a 250hp hero (torb)
tbh I thought his nades always did 140 directly lol
or 125
or something idk
not many junkrat players when I play
there aren't many cause they're not good at him 😎
yeah,the ones I've seen are really good 😃
people don't realize he's the ultimate counter to pharah
but I don't see a lot
uh
nande
hehe
lmfao
Mercy is 😃
I kill Pharahs with Mercy while I'm flying with my own pharah ❤
or just nano valk
❤
lol bad pharahs
OR
just good mercys ❤
I feel like I can kill about 75% of pharahs. The others aren't dumb enough lol
It's the time to acknowledge support players, thank u next
It's 👏 the 👏 time 👏 to 👏 acknowledge 👏 support 👏 players 👏 thank 👏 u 👏 next

KrustyKrabWorker
We're like brothers
...only closer
LMFA
LMFAOOO
I'm only *close* to t500 hit scan players who I can use to abuse Mercy with.
Sorry 💔
yeah but like
in the right hands
junkrat is hitscan
depends how fast the flick of the wrist is
lmao
I know all about the FLICK
Ana + wingman???

nope
DOUBLE NANO
too bad so sad

🥚sactly
TBH
why didn't they replace rez with that invicbiltiy whatever bs thing for mercy???
and like spice her up a lil bit
cuz rez is her whole thing i guess
It is, but as an E ability, it's busted/
Bring 👏 back 👏 season 👏 1 👏 mercy 👏

Tips to get better on widow?
Widows in my rank just click on heads so easily
@Wolfy ?
@Lucidscience ive been summoned Kappa
@dash my friend who is a widow main always tells me to aim for their necks
That way worst case instead of whiffing above them you either get a heads hot or body shot
Oh ive been sitting here for a mean minute wondering why lucid @ed me but the widow question
Yeah lol im searching for widow mains xD
I dont rly have any tips i can say watching pro widows and trying mock there positioning and aim techniques help alot
Also dont be afraid of putting your own spin on it
Oh yeah and aim for the head OMEGALUL
Dont be afraid of bodyshots is a good one because it helps your team more then you just missing
Try to pick if you want to be an agro widow like carpe or pine or a Defense widow like birdring or SureFour
Try to always take different positions and ways to go to make you more unpredictable if you end up making a flank dont fire too fast and take your time a bit so you dont wiff shots
And if they are hard targeting you its not completely a bad thing just make sure your grapple is off cooldown so you can get away but if they go after you thats like 1-3ish people that are off your team so your team can keep moving the payload or take the point
Sometimes I wonder how the enemy team widow knows where I am and instashoots my head but then i realize they have their ult active
Yeah that will happen alot ill usally try to just stay out of any LOS of the widow so that doesn’t happen then just estimate the amount of time till its done if you rly wanted to take it to the next lvl you can look up how many sec till its over and count it in your head
15 seconds and just hit tab and do fast math and dont peak from where you were while it was active rofl
WELCOME @BigManJohn !!!!
I don't know who this girl in the OWL audience is, but she needs to stop screaming
She is just hyped for Seoul okay

@Lucidscience what’s your avg knock back per 10 on Winston?? & what is a good one to aim for??? I’m tryna get my monkey skills up I’m only at 54 avg knock back per 10
@Qi’ra anywhere within the 50-70/per 10 min is actually really good haha! My average per 10 right now is 59.25
@SIX You need sms protect enabled for t500 in comp and im pretty sure you need it for arcade as well but im not totally sure about that

Omg thank you!!! I had no idea what was actually good cause I looked up the rank one Winston and his was 80 per 10 which seemed WILD
But 50-70 I can manage
Maybe someday I’ll hit that 59 like big lucid
I have an account I play dps Moira and my elims per life is 11.59
yesss @Qi’ra haha!! Tbh though i havent been able to play much Winston this season unless ive been going up against dps comps because orisa hog just wrecks winsty poo 😦

Hope things go well lucid! :fxnUP:
Is it possible to download replays?
Or do i have to record them manually
Thank you @Cass 😊
@SIX unfortunately you have to manually record them if you want to save them right now. There have been talks about the dev team rolling out a patch that allows for built-in saving
Ty man would be a good QOL , only makes sense to have it!
Right?!
Question for you bro's
Friends asking me
"Say someone stole my email account, they had full access. They also had access to my OW acc password (Lets say keylogger/malware). Can they change the email on my overwatch account AND the secret Question without having my secret question?"
Last played was like S12 by him, top 500 s5-12
I think you need to know the secret Q to change that... unless you had full access for awhile and physically asked blizz to change it (if u forgot it) or did some hardcore con shit?
~~~ 1 friend said ~~~ as long as you're logged into the acc you can swap the secret Q
Yikes. Hope he can get it back O.O
Theres a PSA to check all old top 500 accs if you have one yall are inactive on.  Might be a target for some con shit
If they provide (photo?) id they can get their stuff back I'm sure
Someone stole my bf's wow account when he was a kid and he was able to get his account back with id (and I think id of his mother as well since he was young)
@SIX they have to know the secret question anyways. Even if they try to social engineer by calling Blizzard to try and change some information they are going to get asked about the secret question and if they dont know it they wont be able to go any further unless the person working on the other line decides to let them
Can change secret Q w/o knowing it .
Logged into bnet , went to my settings, said "select new secret Q" and "answer"
:S
hmmmm.. idk @SIX ,  tbh if someone has access to your email address you are pretty much screwed. Should have had 2 factor authentication setup with your mobile device or at least a backup email address
the thing is that they still have to know your secret question that you had set still though
Weird. Not sure man. I only got those details. He's trying to get it back. Might succeed there but #2 is will it be unbanned is the Q
Doesnt even know why it's banned yet. Just isnt in T500 lists
he will most likely have to contact Blizzard support regarding the ban and give them the story of exactly what happened to get the account unbanned
P.S. @everyone my team and i need a projectile dps ringer for our tournament game tonight, please lmk if your are 4.3k+ projectile dps player and interested

Welcome @TheCorndogLover :leadcrLOVE:
thanks
Ok so me and my buddy are within 500 sr in both LUCIO BALL AND REGULAR COMP and it wont let us que Lucio ball WTF?
Any ideas?
4008 Lucio Ball Vs 3514 = 494
3822 vs 3324 comp = 498. We both reset etc etc still wont let us que Lucio ball "Skill rating too far apart" ?????
HMM...
might be because God hates you and your friend. Maybe
Recycled content ... within 350 now for GM. Not 500.
Even though it shows 500
Its within 350sr @SIX ?
yep
Naisuuu i was having the same issue with a friend when we were trying to queue lucioball as well lol
It's a known bug for master and gm players though, it was reported as of last year but people are still having issues with it.
I mean . For me being gm, it’s 350 difference this year , not the listed 500 correct ?
Normal comp lists 350, arcade Lúcio ball comp lists 500 haha
So idk if it’s much of a bug anymore if it is 350 🤔
Yo who here wants their mind blown at just how much overwatch really cares about cheaters? 😄
If I was to tell you, you could have 3.7M views of exposure cheating with aimbot, 11 reports that game with your team going afk to force a draw, tweets with clips of you cheating to blizzard with them replying to the clip, you wouldn't be banned to this day and still play comp on your account with all that free sr, what would you say? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN1_S5_1F8E&feature=youtu.be&t=132

March 5 btw^
I have the cheaters acc added on my alt, and its still playing comp to this day  with obvious cheater stats haha
@Lucidscience  Is it time to buy a craigslist PC, use 2nd landline+vpn, (New HWID, New ip, never seen ANY of my accounts) buy a level 25 from some dodgy website, and aimhacks, go aimbot and prove to the world you wont be banned (or at least not for like a year if anything??). LULW.
Actually mindblown , forgot bout that clip till today when friend sent me that vid lmfao!!
Geeze thats a blatant aim bot lol. Are you sure that account is banned? Also, name and elo? I was having a hard time seeing the name lol
I just dont understand why people would even waste the time and energy on an aimbot. Especially in competitive play it just ruins the game imo
@Lucidscience
What i'd pay to ask whos in charge if I was a millionaire. Ok lets say he toggled 1 game, 11 reports, tweets of that clip that were replied too by Blizzard saying to report it in game,
(overlooked) < Like LULHOW?
Now 3.7 million views on it, he still gucci? Cmon.
Makes even the most anti cheating player want to shoot his own dick off.
The only viable excuses I can think of is A) Blizzard employee owned acc B) Sucking off the dept that deals with reports.
@Lucidscience  how much hero dmg/10 you do on orissa
Idk im out and about rn ill tell you in a big
BryanThonk
Bit* lol
@SIX 5,149 per 10 on orisa so far this szn
ahh 4,559 . Was wondering if its normally low
I mean i don't play main tank but.. ye lol
i mean tbh thats definitely not the most important statistic but yeah
tank statistics are much different than other roles due to so many other factors that are in play during a game
its a lot easier to look at a DPS player or even a support players stats and determine what a baseline number should be for a given statistic but its a lot different with tanks
Yeah I am just used to the good ol goats days with zarya at like 10k+ lmao
Back before we afk'd half the game in bunker :3
yeah for sure lol
like tbh any number for an orisa over 7k is pretty yikes because that means the orisa isnt pressuring shield like they should be
hero damage per 10 that is
That just means the enemy team is throwing
No shield XD
yeah looool

[OVERWATCH] Wall Hackers in Competitive :(
Ran into a wall hacker, i was wrong at the start, corrected myself. I was even more mindblown lol
Anyone here play overwatch on a gaming laptop?
Used to until this year. Dark times
Kind of been meaning to get one for the longest time due to my job, even if its not for overwatch, but like *any* gaming, or aim training to stay warm etc while away for 1-3 weeks at a time.... Problem is 144hz laptops.... jeez $$
Yeaaah if you have the $$$ to buy a really nice laptop then do it but dont settle for anything less
You need a GOOD gaming laptop to run games at a decent framerate, otherwise your just going to be beating yourself up, wondering why you spent money on it lol
hai
BIG WAZAMAN!!!!
oof only an intern
1 sec
try again lol
coo beans
cool\
cooolioo
I was thinking just a budget gaming laptop @Lucidscience . Something where if I am at work in remote locations I can at least stay “warm” on aim trainers on steam or offline FPS games etc . Just stay kinda sorta dialed in / not get bored af you know? Not like The internets good enough the places I go to even launch overwatch haha
ahh okay thats fair. Well in that case @SIX just buy a budget top!! Just make sure it can run Overwatch once you get in an area with decent internet at least !!!
I wouldn’t use it to play overwatch though like I only play OW from my home setup, wouldn’t trust a laptop lmao. Plus I don’t wana spend like 2-3K on one that’ll run it mint because it’s like if I’m in a spot where the internet will run overwatch / I want to play OW,  I am probably at home anyways 😂
Just FPS games / aim trainers . I don’t have a laptop at all so.

everyone and their grandmother has been having to play Orisa this season LOL
thinkingnoose
yeah...
@Lucidscience Team Vivid OP 😛
I hate having to play Orissa lol
And the worst part is I’ve never played her in my life maybe 1 hour on her before this season, and I have like a 70% win rate  on her LMAO
Like this should not happen at gm level haha
They should buff junkrats grenades to instantly delete orisa shields
I’m SO SICK OF IT
I completely agree
Alternatively it’d be interesting if her shield functioned like sigmas and reins. So it has an internal life bar that can only recharge when it’s NOT deployed
Yeah I agree it’s almost as if I shoot 5 shots into it with hog, hanzo is breaking it our Orissa is etc , boom new shield as I reload with hog it’s kinda fucked . But every time I play Orissa it’s almost as if my shields are gone in seconds
I like the recharge when not deployed idea. Give it a larger health or something but the cooldown takes effect when it’s broken or after X period of time or on command broken idk
lol
Freeze is 55 damage per seconds with 1.5 seconds of freezing, plus 1.5 seconds of frozen
so that’s 82.5 damage on just freezing alone
now taking headshot damage that is 150 damage into account, that’s 232 damage
AND, if we take frame data into account, you can get 2 headshots onto an enemy if you time the freeze right, so that makes it 383 damage
PLUS melee which is 30
that’s 401 damage in 4 steps with simple frame data knowledge.
Damage numbers
Brb becoming a Mei main now
amazing
i believe its aMEIzing lol
That's definitely ana:-mei-zen decision to make.
LUL
But wait there’s more : How much ult charge did Mei get from the freeze/x2 headshot/Meele combo lol
Prrobably too much
not sure, but the 12% decrease to ult charge feels like nothing to Mei
I mean it’s a 0 skill hero with like the lowest ceiling what do you expect lol
@Lucidscience  playing the dirty baptism
naisuuu
How to hard carry with bap. Immortality on CD lmao
Kill entire team then rush the spawn smashing Q at their front door :sideCorn:
Yo @Lucidscience  I’m pro 2-2-2. (Ish) . I want 2-2-1-1 But I do agree there is some hard bullshit with it . If you’re in comp now and a healer or tank or dps leaves . You can (sometimes) hold out for a win, draw etc by filling that role . You get a leaver in 2-2-2 you’re unable to fill the roll. Or flex to a roll that *might work* such as a dps leavinf , fuck it go 3 tank 2 heals know what I mean?
yeah i guess @SIX , i mean it does make the game more difficult when theres a leaver but 2-2-2 will make games better overall
Yeah just kinda never thought of that downside till today lol
@Lucidscience join me
or drag me
haha 1 sec lol

Ok Gamers. In the market for a mouse maybe. Thoughts on Logitech G Pro Wireless, Alternate Suggestions? Hmm
thats the one i have
it's very good, love it
i like that it's symmetrical
i think seagull used it and that's how i found out
K dont make fun of me but like i come from something arguably worse than something like this
you'll def have to get comfortable with it! I went from a weird shaped monstrosity to the simplicity of the logitech and it feels great
Had a Naga Chroma, shit failed on me like 1 yr after the 2? idk yr warranty. Bullshitted them, got warranty, free Naga Trinity with 3 sideplates interchangeable , I use the 12 button. Sure its a MMO mouse, but i love my macros for in game, my hands are big, work the trades , workout etc so i kind of like now you see it now you dont to mice so idk.
I cant have a mouse too small
are you able to try it out at best buy or someplace that shows them?
i know i saw the wireless ones there a few months ago

I see like 5 new people joined so welcome guys! I'd tag you all but it's like 530 am and I'm on mobile so 🤷
Love y'all hope you have a good time here ♥
Also those screenshots are sick!
The Hanzo one is so fuckin funny
You crank the detail right up on OW for those screenshots? Like I play on lowwwww settings. Those high settings plus the high resolution (like 9x?) screenshot quality? Doesnt it just freeze the game for a sec when it saves it lol
They looks nuts though ya!
@Cass  Yeah the Hanzo thats aimbot Bizz :Kappa:
Logged out, came back in (quick reset). Hit with this, Legit getting these on an hourly basis. They cracking down BOIS., Ban the fucks that "don't care because 2-2-2 is coming soon" Y'all wont be allowed to even compete in 2-2-2 I hope.
Hope slowly being restored O.O
Those are just normal screenshots from the recorded footage. The match replay didn’t save for me. Literally everyone else got one though 😦 but yeah ultra high detail always
Jeez that sucks :l
And ultra high jeeeeez big pc lol
yeah..ever since I got a 1080 I've always played on ultra, never had performance problems
i know some people say "but low hides xyz" but it's not really a problem
@Lucidscience  imagine stream sniping shroud, locking him in spawn like that and hooking him out as bastion? He would probably uninstall. lol.
yeah man hahahaha
that bastion got blown out
😂

Whos all in the ow discord?
How tf do you invite someone to this these days, no option / no code listed anywhere?
For THIS server?
Nooo "The O.W." @SIX ?
The O.W. yes
Slashers
I am in it for the past idk half year or whatever but I got invited by a buddy. Seems you gotta know someone pretty damn good to get in (Mod/admin)? Unless its the odd time its "open"?
You just have to @ slasher on Twitter
It’s not open invite
the O.W. is on a strict invite basis now
they dont just invite anybody anymore
im pretty sure the rule stands of having to be top500 within the past couple seasons
Reallly eh.
Was just filled with spam i guess

@Trashmankind  You can be my youtube editor once I get 1k subs.
You got it 😎
Man, i have a few 200-300-500k view videos, before the dumb new rules of 1k subs for ad revenue, I was making good ad revenue. So if I could hit 1K subs, Lucid said to contact you for video producing cause ya you killed the science fair trailer. Actual pogchamp. No sense in outsourcing to fiverr when someone in our circle can do a better job lol
Plus i need all the editing i can get
Bizz just embarrasses me  maybe we can make it look like i hit 9.9/10 shots also?

Hehe 😈 but that’s awesome you’ve been able to rack up views, but yeah gotta get subs now :/
Somebody at Apple is playing in the tournament

Gl! My tank placements were so scuffed lol, haven’t tanked in comp since like season 2
Hey @Trashmankind  you any good with obs , or just audio in general?
Legit, 10 bucks to the first person who can tell me how this sounds so *soft*? Like how is his obs audio like this. Whoever can tell me gets 10 bucks im so rattled trying to get better audio from my blue yeti + Voice meeter banana its making me wana break stuff 😦

It so clear for comms. But you can understand the game still, and the music. But the comms, this is MINT.
What settings do you have on your mic in obs? I have a blue spark blackout so I don't have to fiddle very much with settings, just the noise suppressor filter
Ill add you pm me @Trashmankind
I got a little word of advice for healer mains . I just learnt the hardway wtf.
Here is a word of advice for all healer mains.
DO NOT USE BAP IN SEASON 18 PLACEMENTS.
I went 4020 final to 4260? 4-1 with mercy... 7k ish heals per 10.. never on fire, hardly any elims. typical. +200 some sr
I play bap on a 4027 final account,
I went 3-2, I had roughly 13,200 healing avg per 10 (Absolute animal LOL), crazy elims and dmg, on fire like 99% of games, just going sweaty.
3888 from 4027
Its the same as when ASHE came out. There isnt enough percentile data to accurately realize that 13k heals per 10, and being on fire 247, isnt normal or below avg. When ashe came out you could get 100 elim 50k dmg, 10 placements ina row fresh acc, and place 2300 (LOL Like legit)
GAME IS SCUFFFFED
Role Q is fucked
yeah when i said tank  main incoming that was before it placed me at 2137 for tank lmaooooooooooooo
TOP500 Lucid5BigHuge
i went 4-1 and had golds and silvers every game but ya know
2137
Man I seen Lucid login and I was on a good role there for awhile . I logged out. Not a chamce I am queing into that animal .
There is something seriously wrong with BAP though. I told a few friends but I forgot to tell 1 and he had went 4-1, lost 90 sr rofl. With similar stats to mine. Not a chance you go 4-1 with 14k heals/10 mins, on fire like 90% of the games. Poppin ults every fight getting assists like crazy and lose 90 sr over 1 loss. I guess its just not enough percentile info for the system to know whats good, whats shit , whats average.
Its like it doesnt count your wins. But heavily counts losses.
As soon as i finished that last game it was like rub your hands together lets see the sky rocket in sr, lose 140 sr. Just leaned back in my chair and said 343 ...... hurrrrry the fuck up pweeeeeese
@TheAdam
brilliant
Yeah @SIX i think that there is still a lot that they need to work out with the role queue system
They need an mmr reset for every other role that isnt your main role or something because there are a lot of people that are playing at a higher sr than they should for a role they barely play bbecause the system is still using the last season's final SR to base the placements off of
how  could they determine a main role? There was an emphasis on how well you can flex, but with role queue that's not a thing. You'd have plenty of people with equal time across more than one role
I wish they'd just flat out reset the mmr
👆 Clap
Yeah i agree man
Thats exactly how i feel with my dps lol
HOWEVER if they reset everyone's mmr they'd have to base performance on something. They did that with season 1 using qp sr in combination right?
they had tons of qp data before comp was released
but at least they're trying with an actual beta comp. But why not take it further and do a beta with an mmr wipe to see how everyone places
They could just do like what league of legends does
your placements start on at x rating and you gain invis boosted sr during placement games
so people still have to climb a bit afterwards but aren't getting utterly fucked during placements
well they will if they're bad but that's how mafia works
you would get screwed if for every single placement you went against pros, rip rng?
That's truuuuuue
Get a Hog that trolls and asks to be reported
Get a Genji that refuses to switch off against Doubler Barrier and Doomfist that kills the supports
GOTTA LOVE 3000MS OUT OF NOWHERE AND BEING KICKED FROM THE MATCH!
I hate this game sometimes, not even allowed to play support if i tried
Blizz shot themselves in foot releasing the deetz on role Q so early in S17. Everyone stopped caring.
Then you think they'd learn?
Nope.
"BTW none of this role Q beta will even be on your profile once s18 drops, it doesnt matter atttttt allll they say, the first day its released
Shoot themselves in the foot 2 times..... b2b throw seasons 😄
So remember that Bap 4W-1L..., 14k heals/10 avg/on ffire 247 just a dumpster fire pub stomp....... -200sr ish from my  final sr on s17? L.
Here's something for ya to figure out
Lost 3 tank games due to throwers on my OG (SIX) acc. I said welp. FUUUCk it. I wana see what happens when you go 0-5.
-109sr from my final on S17..... going 0-5 rofl. Bap placements, 4-1 absolute popping, -200 and some !? XD Same elo on both accs, low GM.
Do less, get given more apparently:WaitWhat:
1) How do i lose 200 sr from going 4 wins 1 loss
2) How do i only lose 109 sr going 0 wins 5 loss
I've decided to 100% skip season 18, or a verrry big chunk of it. Because like you said Lucid. Placements for 3 roles, are based off S17 SR. So if you 1 trick lucio, your not gunna be that sr on dps or tank BUT your in those sr games... such a meme lol
Yeaaaah man hahhaha
❌
Yeah like shits wack LOL. I mean WATER was in my game yesterday, on the WELL, he had 4k dmg on sigma all game....... We got stomped lmao. "Sorry guys, not my main hero" Well no sht... you can link 12 ghost dashes together in traiining range on genji blind folded but you do 4k fucking dmg in  15 mins on sigma......
Games are too meme
Full mmr reset 100% needed
Like he actually said sorry guys this aint my main lLMAO
ffs
XD
actually true
same goes for me if i were to play dps lol
like i can play support up to a 4.3k level but my dps is max 4k lol
can the new meta be junk+bastion to fetus deletus all these SHIELDS being thrust up my captain's quarters
only in a junkrat 1 tricks world would that be enjoyable LOL
I only get stronger when there's a junk on the other team
This is so ridiculous . FPS btw
There is more shields, and stuns than there is guns in this game
invulnerabilities . Oh let me shift as mei, reaper, oh bap plopped an E down. Sombra TP
JEEEZ
Who do we even hire
we need a super junkrat
one grenade destroys a shield
Cooldown of like 20 seconds on it haha
I just thought of the best ultimate ever
One that disables all shields and teleports etc
Can you still use a teleported after a sombra ult? I’ve never noticed
I thought of the best ultimate ever.
One that slaps blizzard in the head for announcing 2-2-2 rendering S17 a throw "idc, role Q is coming next season" type shit show, then releasing a beta for like an entire month long almost that has no bearing on your account whatsoever rendering yet another month, a throw month.
Only way to climb sr, is to duo Q as tanks, go against solo Q tanks that throw on sigma. Ez clap
Sad that this game has become a joke for the last 2 months.
They're ruining their playerbase for themselves early. Halo's gunna ass rape em, they dont gotta screw it for themselves, 343 got that covered already
Anyone down 4 some QP?
just got back from the pool and im straight kickin it now, otherwise i would be

:lucids5BigHUGE:
That’s a sweet shout out
Anyone get a look at combined, tank, supp and dps top 500 lists? Games dead , change my mind :L
Diam/master ez top 500. 25 games per role, 75 for combined to be on lists. 1 week in 3 pages for combined, individuals are all diam/master elo L.
i mean how many people care enough about a beta that doesn't count to keep grinding in comp?
plenty did placements but that's all
I do it for fun and the comp points tbh
Role lock makes me rage way less
I mean yeah true the bulk points are nice , 15 games buncha points but like ... yeah you can get more if u play and play and play just going for points / fun. Idk I guess I expected more ppl than just 3 pages haha

Best news of my life ^^^^^^^
@Lucidscience  thoughts !?!?
thats actually a power move by BIG DADDY KAPLAN
so it wont show up on your career profile but season 18 will use your final rank for each role during placements
Guess I’m top 500 across the board forever then 🤷‍♂️
WOW CLASSIC IS OUT
I really can't even use dwarf fortress texture packs without a gpu smh

ahh sah Discordians
What’s the deal with the beyond the meat burger ? Heard it’s got the same ingredients as dog food. Anyways @Lucidscience  I heard the placements are soooooooo messed up with season 18, I’ve been away for 2 weeks. Can you confirm?
Spent 7 days up north at work. 7 days at a buddies cottage with friends  back home in the “east coast beast coast” lmao, come back to civilization “BEYOND MEAT BURGER” lmao wtf
LOL @SIX 😂 ... yeah dude there was a bug with season 18 placeys and people were placing gold and getting like 5-10 sr per win/loss and people were thinking it was the MMR reset lol, but blizzard extended the role queue season to fix bugs
Lmao
So it’s still a beta?
Ohh, you mean They extended it and it just finished?
Now it’s s18 - still buggy- placements lol
Yeah dude haha i havent been on to check yet today if role queue beta season is over yet
Apparently they extended it a week I hear :LUL: embarrassing game
Ptr . Long enough beta. Now a major flaw causing a season cancel and just an extended beta?! Lmao

I got a quick debate.
Single monitor setup lets say for example. 144hz 1ms yadayada.
- Do you play OW in : FullScreen/Borderless Windowed/Windowed? And why?
I've always played in windowed mode- with 1 monitor, and 2 monitors. Reason being is alt tabbing is a known culprit for the ol rendering device lost on good ol game of OW. So if I never have to alt tab, I am at a seriously lower risk for that error.
How much worse really is the game in windowed vs say fullscreen or borderless? Is it crazy better or Id rather have less risk of losing SR due to rendering device lost, and have a bit more input lag on windowed kinda predicament ?
Yes i have played windowed, Since BETA
OOF
@Nuvalin add Pro-OwO on uplay
I play windowed mode
Not because of errors but because I do tab out frequently so it's easier
For the same reason I do? hit esc and just click w/e quickly rather than alt tab
Plus it's easier to stream it windowed imo
Borderless windowed works the same for dual monitor streaming
iirc
Well if I need to get to something underneath I can just minimize it
true
i play borderless windowed..so no alt tabbing but i still frequently get the rendering device lost error. unlucky.
So i mean the little bit better performance / less input lag from full screen, or borderless windowed. Isnt a big deal over windowed i guess when it comes down to it? I mean ok in unreal high tier hitscan widow v widow youll want every single little edge you can get but for the ease of access, the performance gain is minimal?
I've only gotten that error once and it was because my gpu actually broke
lmao
I used to get it . But i have since dialed in my clock speeds and I knock on god damn wood i shouldnt even be typing this I havent gotten the error since, its because its the STRIX 1060 OC edition, anything OC this game hates for some reason. Oh you overclock the gpu or it comes factory overclocked, lemme dc you.
-.-
So its underclocked slightly
Used to get it 1 in 50 ish games. Havent seen the error in like 5 months since the underclock. Brb lemme go get that error now lol

Gyazo
Gyazo
1 win on hog. 5-0.
like 13k hero dmg/10 avg etc. Pretty wild stats
Lose 500 sr
OMEGA
Donated it to the welfare I guess. Blizz saw I went so hard they gave it away to some 3k player so he can feel ok about his 5 losses in placements because he got given a bonus 500 sr
so he can play in our games. Fuck OW am out
unlucky
? what
what sr was the account before?
2922 final S14
was that the last final?
2922
s14
lol
okay then thats probably what it went off of
How....
idk bbbbroken
5-0 , unreal stats, place 2400 from 2922 lmao
yeah idk
Haha
Polished game
im gunna tweet them later about it tbh something is obviously wrong. But the look on my face was priceless I bet
Rolled all 5 placements, lickin my lips for the SR into diam on this acc
2400
LOL
:peepoWTF:
I actually googled it to see like, cause my buddy in the group, he gained like 400 ish sr.
I said what glitch do u know, that i dont know
thats cucked me

We just had one about 2 weeks ago! So I'm not sure when the next one will be
If you have any ideas or suggestions tho feel free to post in #the-science-experiment 👀
Yea, I tried entering but most of my teammates had real life happening so they couldn't make it. ^_^ I work for Esports Arena and wanted to post about it to our Overwatch communities if there were any plans for another one.
Oh hell yeah! We'll make sure to tag ya when we get the next event planned 😘
Thank you 😃 That would be awesome. I really wish you guys the best. I love overwatch 😁

Whats good dude?
Fucking tilt mode in the arctic I’m going nuts
I just wana go home and start my 10+ days off lol
30 days straight , 12 hours a day gets rough .
With limited ass SLOOOOW WiFi and nothing else
Be switching to a 21/14 or a 14/7 if all goes well here soon. 14/7 would be pretty baller
Are you in 4600s yet
Damn bruv you got this, and no LOL i peaked 4487 tho
Or 4478 something like that this season
Still plan on going for 4500 by the end of the szn
4500 tank. 2000 dps and heals :Lucid5BigHuge:
LOLOL
CAD PRICES . $499 new 144hz DYAC monitor (benq zowie) $529 for the 240hz basic one (non dyac) $598 for the XL2546 240hz with DYAC (their best monitor atm) I’m torn on what to get. Kinda worried if I can’t pull 240fps I might be SOL - might run like shit? I can pull 144, stream 144 1080p/60 perfect all day. But I know I couldny do that at 240. What happens if I cap 145 still, but I’m using a 240hz benq zowie? Run like shit ? (Would be just until I get a 2080 ti)
Input?
144 dyac line or the 240 dyac line will be my new main monitor so. It’s 1 or the other rn lol
Just wondering if it would stutter @ 144 capped FPS being a 240 hz monitor
$499 for a 144hz ?? I got mine for like $179
yeah don't spend 500 lmaoooo
that's the one I have
$190

Yes. Y they do dat?
Because its a chance for players to get skins faster,. without buying boxes or playing the game i guess lol
LUL
lucids tank partner
lost that game lol
Lost a lot on the last handful of games due to widow cheaters... sooo many of em... OWL sleepy gave us a draw though ❤
on 1 of em
4140 combined sr will be top 100 as of rn.
That is totally doable considering my tanks sitting 4025. Grab a couple hundred sr there easily.
GOALS
Huuuuge dude!!
@Lucidscience  read pm

suhh dude!
okay chat
500 IQ idea here
i should start streaming on Mixer
there are like literally no Overwatch streamers
thoughts>?
Mixer has a much smaller user base
Wouldn't hurt if you wanted to give it a shot tho
But I can't remember their requirements for their version of affiliate
its a bot lmao
f
Tbh you could prob talk your way into affiliate to even stream for them
They dont wana make deals. They can sink lol
You might not even need affiliate over there. Depends what they offer in terms of bitrate caps/resolution/downscale options etc
Lucidscience (@Lucidsciencetv)
Showing these nerds what a fat shatter really looks like #TOPSHOTTA https://t.co/4Ieh8oMOUh
Twitter
^^^
@SIX @Cass this is true, idk if its worth it or not, i see a market but not at the same time
twitch overwatch is oversaturated but mixer doesnt have many users but an opportunity for a streamer because there are no big overwatch streamers
SIX (@ow_six69)
LF uwu Mercy Pocket. Will supply Bento Box. Tryna sauce this DPS.
Twitter
If it's something you want to try it's always worth a shot!
I got a sweet deal runnin
Limited time
@Lucidscience  U wan a bento box fam
Just keep in mind you won't be getting any $$$$ from being on mixer till you get their affiliate
unless people donate
very truuu
I mean the payout prob take awhile isnt it 100 cap
Its more so do they offer a decent bitrate/options for viewers to downscale etc
Because some viewers cant watch a 1080/60 w/o buffering
And iirc before affiliate. Whatever you stream as. Is the only option for the viewer
After affiliate, they can choose, 720/60 etc even if you are streaming 1080/60
IK when i stream on my alt :LUL:  It's 1080/60 or nothin for the viewer i saw.
i see, good food for thought @SIX
Gyazo
when the long flank works
77.69 knocked back enemys avg per 10 min, most played hero too LOL , 3 hrs of hammond. 6-2

Come
Been talked about at blizz con
Yep Overwatch 2 confirmed
I'm so glad all the skins move with you
It rubs the lotion on its skin
Basically just PVE mode / new skins will be ow2 . The pvp ow2 gets is in ow1
What I gather
Pve plus progression
Character upgrades and things
I would hope that how we get new maps nearly regularly would equate to getting new big missions regularly

OMEGALUL peepoS
Cum play qp wit me then big boy
Lmao be careful queuing overwatch for the next 5 seasons unless decay becomes a thing
All the 1 trick mercy mains at 4100, queuing tank and dps and losing all 5 still being 3900 and shit like “waaaaaat I’m gunna camp this sr that’s higher than I thought I’d get”
Then queuing into 3900/4k placements again next season because no decay because blizzards fucking retarded:)))))))
People got the “Ima crank out 4300 all roles in 1-2 days and just sit on my thumb and rotate for 2 months and still finish top 50 looooool throw it in the Twitter bio PEAK 50 BOIIIIS (leaves out the fact it was role Q) Like what the fuck were they thinking lmao.
Ima do that rn
FUG it
We need decay back or games are gunna continue to always be aids . No matter what placements will always be aids but after placements when you aren’t getting placement games will be better with decay
What’s your take on it @Lucidscience
GG @SIX, you just advanced to level 3!

Oh noooooo
I hope you get the next one!
thanks haha
it was a super close game we were up 2-0 and just needed 1 more map but the maps that were played thereafter favored the other team and their pharah/mercy/ball comps that they like to run and we got reverse swept
Anyone in here good with graphics design? Photoshop in general? Im talking to design a small background image related to the game Rust. Add my server name on top, maybe some artistic touch- end goal = i send the file to a sticker maker and get palm size/slightly smaller stickers made out of em.
If you are a GFX person and pretty good at it DM me if you can do it. Will pay you whatever you want within reason if I can get it done within a day or 2.
Will credit tf outta you too considering like 500 some ppl in the discord/120avg pop/top100 servers worldwide peak is waiting > Guy I hire on fiverr backed out last minute and need it done within a day or so. Doesnt have to look like the guy who invented photoshop did it him/herself just decent lol XD
DM if interested<3
Make me watch 4 hours of Doomfist plays on ladder, and i won't care anymore than when i started
But give me a set of 3 of any tournament, and i'm loving it.
There’s something about tournament play that just intrigues me to no end.
@SIX i can ask @js about it, hes pretty good with gfx. Also, i can use photoshop but as far as creative touches go i might not be the dude to do it lol
@Skeleton Yardel Ive always loved tournament play. Its why I host the science fair every year haha! Something about the competition and drive to win that i enjoy

We need your help
@Nuvalin how is everything going over there?

ooooof hate to see it @Nuvalin lol , keep that phone on silent during class bruv
I know eighth!
I hate that feeling!
@Lucidscience asuh bruv
whats good miracle whip
bro good idea
Pinned a message.
@Lucidscience where r u
Inting my games
Because Orissa is banned doesn’t mean you need to do that m8 :Kappa:
Why’s there different bans in owl than live game? Why are live game bans 3/4 useless bans? Mei sure . But Orissa bap??? Hanzo when compared to cree isn’t a problem wtf
Which team is paying under the table cash to win games? Fuck sake that shits so fake it’s like WWE
Always knew OWL was rigged
Oh we don’t have a widow AND a cree specialist we only have a widow specialist that isn’t as good as theirs. Let’s drop 20k under the table to blizz to ban both hero so that team that has 2 hitscan specialists can’t play :Kappa:
Till they literally ban most picked or draw for bans live on camera I don’t believe that shit
And why’s it different than live game? Damn this shit triggers me the games so fucked for 5 seasons of cheaters they don’t care about to meta issues they don’t fix to this lol who chose these useless bans
@SIX bruh they literally did a draw for bans on cam haha
thats funny AF tho LOL
yeh but i dont buy the bans
IRONIC as fuck its widow cree cmon
Keeping track on which teams are playing when retard bans happen to find out which ones getting the edge more than the other >:)
But whys the bans different than LIVE GAME WTF
Whys LIVE GAME BANS USELESS
Whos in charge here!? Cant organize a rock fight in a gravel pit doesnt even know his own fuckin game
YUH letz uhhhhhh yeh ban that shield spammer hanzo and the horse everyone plays, also bap ppl hated bap 3 months ago so lets ban him sweet looks good to me
😂
Gaurentee the person who picked those 3 didnt pick mei
Someone with brain picked mei
DM ME @Lucidscience
got shit 2 do
The reason for the bans is to pressure teams to main junkrat
I understand the conspiracy on a molecular level
I can see it now, zarya, bap, mei, pharah get banned all at once and suddenly junk becomes the messiah
LOL
One of these days lucid...one of these days you’ll see it live-streamed grand finals owl “junkrat one trick commits unsportsmanlike conduct after tea bagging entire enemy team after the fattest tire since American diabetes”
GG @Trashmankind, you just advanced to level 7!
Lmao
Every owl teams on the scout for the most nutty JSILLY ladder
2020
@Trashmankind  hits contenders @Lucidscience is still benched as Orissa is banned :Kappa:

[NEW HERO – COMING SOON] Echo Origin Story | Overwatch
Introducing Echo. An evolutionary robot programmed with a rapidly adapting artificial intelligence, Echo represents the cutting edge of technology.

Follow us on Twitter: http:...
No Junkrat 2 😦 _yet_
nah
Echo is actually broken
Her Sticky Bombs are overtuned, and her ult charge rate when she copies is way to overdone
All I want
Is to see
Echo copy echo
And a ffa deathmatch all echo ulting each other
And echo copying an echo that is currently copying someone
Finally we can nano our own Ana
The age has come
Bahahhaha @Trashmankind always coming up with the craziest sheeit
Shes not as broken as i thought she would be
I think the Devs did a good job with her
Her shift ability could potentially use a rework because of how fast the transition of her hitbox is when used
Other than that i think shes a skillfull hero
Pretty balanced
The meta will soon become just heroes with weak ultimates just to counter Echo.
@Mystfire LOOL
HAH throwing is the meta
I’m glad she only has the one defensive ability, and even then it’s not gonna save you 100% from someone with good aim
I feel like she should get ONE copied ult though, but she needs more play time to see how well we can work around it
Thats facts

Another big win today against Nocturnal
Was it a blowout
TFW you beat not only a triple stack, but a boosted Mercy E girl pocket
pikaO
GG @Skeleton Yardel, you just advanced to level 4!
RANK 1 ZARYA

Is the SMS required to be on top 500 list JUST the Blizzard mobile authenticator app thing?
The thing you hit accept or deny on for the logins?
Anyone know?
Friends asking and i forget tbh, i know i have that for SIX but idk if i had anything else

@Trashmankind ty
OWL this year is so scuffed, it's painful to watch
@Lucidscience was petal on your team?
yeah
y
he wasnt even the carry lol
Ok jw, I didn’t see the roster updated I guess lol
yeah we dropped our original hitscan and offtank
I saw someone on twitter complaining about it
About petal lol
yeah that dude is just immature and mad about the L
its a team game , the better team wins
Yup
you know how it be
No 1v6 man
Unless you got me on Zarya and i waste my Grav
then everyone just yells at me
Lol but that’s different, how can you have high performing team play and  great synergy with random matchmaking?
It IS possible but it’s harder
oh without question
ladder is a mess of randomness.
On a real team that has emotionally intelligent players, you missing a grav wouldn’t make everyone turn on you. We all make mistakes but we do it together
Ladder can be positive too, I think about harbleu and how kind he is when people make mistakes
It's really the only part of Zarya i suck at
lol are you going for fat gravs or impactful gravs
I go for "hey i got 4 people, and now i'm dead"
so, very fat gravs
That sounds like the sombra problem I see a lot, where she emps then dies instantly cause no one can followup
yeah , always look for a follow up when you grav
otherwise its wasted
yeah, i need to call out when to grav
same thing with shatter
and emp
i see 100 charge, and think "yeah, PoTG time"
No, shatter is 1v6 win every time no followup 😆
The Rein mind games are fun
but blocking a Shatter with your bubble is spicy

Nipple only
OMEGALUL kekw
OH NO
OMEGALUL kekw
HA
Yup....
What is it with Boston?
It’s the clams
who knows loool
Yo if anyone gets a Valorant key drop today time stamp it... was it beginning mid or end of a stream. Ima guess its end of all streams or near the end same as they ran the first ones... They chose X streamers to give drops to. Then @ the end they dropped mad keys then now today those ppl who got em can run at it all 50k of them, so when do the other 50k key drops happen today? End of a time period/end of streams or o.O?
people are getting them right now in the middle of some, i don't think it matters what stream you're watching
check their twitter too, the turned off drops 5 hours ago for an issue resolution lol but must have turned them back on not too long ago
I got a key lol

@Lucidscience oh nonono :KEKW: . I’ve seen this happen a couple times personally. Probably because they’re on 99% of overwatch accounts avoid list - the other 1% don’t know them yet or are trying to snipe and int :OMEGALUL:

TOASTERRR
“You may experience longer queue times because you consistently burn toast”
Are they just both super shitty players?
I've never heard of them before
Evil toaster is literally doing stupid shit on his main and alts EVERY day- known as the OTF Orissa that feeds games . I went against him and he had 2 of my friends on the Enemy team as dps on Smurf’s cause they told me their names at end of game - didn’t even know it was them and they’re cracked ...... they held us right after we got first checkpoint of Havana.... baaaad game. Well on our Defence- we ended up winning lmfao. I go back and watch toasters stream- he’s literally being flamed the entire game and throwing - like decided to talk to chat 247 and it got him fucked so many times that everyone just lost it on him lmfao. Actually won a game when he had 2 4.5k dps players on his team in 4.1k elo..... he can fuck up just about anything . And moreweth is a ball 1 trick that feeds his dick off so hard - everyone on Eu either avoids him, dodges his games or throws them so he plays on NA now and it’s almost to the same point
Tl;Dr - 2 fucking absolute idiots
But they’re gm so they deserve to be there obviously

Ana also "nice correction asshole" LOL
Soldier, that's not an event skin.
Running it down always & someone mad lmao. I know at least 4 others that have gotten this - and they AT WORST CASE said 1 thing that wasn’t even a bad thing to say- the enemy team just mass reported it . 1 dude I know doesn’t even swear like super religious type shit and maxed border qp / arcade warrior type and he’s like excuse me? Lol
So they give warnings over false flags now and mass reports at enemy teams being salty you won and saying avoid someone? Nice !
Ft the 5 mins of comp vs 2 dps cheaters btw ^ why don’t you go solve that issue instead of harassing the general public blizz you fucks
@Lucidscience  further encouraging your life situation movin on from this bullshit game
Such a joke
I left overwatch like 5 months ago

Guns for Canada or bust
& I dont even live there
I got suspended on S!X for abusive language roflll
till june 1, so 7 days
they can do this; but not ban cheaters
nice !
Well, lucky for them my work might be delayed a week, so I may return on June 1 for a few days maybe for loot boxes and levels and such as I cbf to play comp on six due to cheaters
But !NOMATCHTEXTCHATONS!XEVERSOFTTHROWNATION
Never again, /hidechat squad
fuck everyone , missed a play? Shoulda had a mic
fuck this cocksucking game
glad once work starts im quittin for good
legit rolled a FFA first place
insta pops me outta game
I was like I clapped their heads yeah but i wasnt fuckin cheatin wtf
Gyazo
Then saw abusive chat
LMAO
So i guess they just suspend not even mute these days
due to soft throw
thats ok, im /hidechat soft throw on cooldown now and they cant even say shit bout it.
cant even ban hackers but suspend u for week over chat
legit only thing i ever said to anyone thats abusive level- would be calling hackers cunts or something
which tbf, if i was aussie
id prob get away with it
ffs
Ima make appeal and say wtf m8 im aussie
just for memes
cause i can confirm ive never said anything else on SIX its my OG main i keep in good standards lol, my alts however LOOL
bro
what arre you on
youre like sscreaming about something and im so confused, all ik is ur acc got banned
Hahahha
A good ole Six ban
@Nuvalin  7 day suspension
For calling out a hacker in game
On six I play with the same 6 stack just for leveling and loot boxes recently as I don’t bother with comp on it for a long time now . So the company blizzard can’t ban hackers I’ve encountered the same ones for months now on alts - yet if I call someone out for toggling in arcade / qp I get a 7 day suspension for abusive chat lollllll during an event - I also looked deeper into it and a lot of people I know are getting it and randoms on forums unironically during the event atm so they’re basically trying to force buying loot boxes
Sad
One friend is super religious and he’s 7 day banned and the guy hardly says the word fuck you couldn’t pay him enough to say it :KEKW: Fucking garbage company
Judging by forums reddit etc there seems to be an issue with report system so; I assume this is a mistake on their end and or over reaction for loot box purchase farming
Even hardstuck bronze accs with open profiles are being banned for cheating lmao. And he’s a rein player - there’s an uproar atm on every forum
Somethings fishy
Most complaining about falseban have come back and said they have been un banned - all them seemingly unironically have valorant anti cheat installed. MonkaW
The only thing I ever say in chat is that Tom Brady kissed his son on the lips. I keep quiet otherwise so no banny in my fanny
I just don't play ow
I'm toxic as fuck and I've never even gotten a warning
You gunna get 7 day suspension @Cass  they don’t warn anymore :KEKW:
Mute = soft throwing games
So they just say fuck ya
On a side note
Scamademic memes are the best
I’ve never been reported in my life. I use a rotating blizzard ID and I’m untouchable
Wouldn’t be surprised if something as simple as that works
First ever support placement match
Yeah, might play Moira more.
Moira is ez sr

omg from the original how to play rein vid
he was EIGHT YEARS OLD
I renamed that video "remember where you came from" because I wanted to be able to look back on that piece of art if I ever make it, and to mainly  see how far my gameplay has come since then LOL
its so funny dude hahaha

we were about to win lol
im just blowing backs out on hughmungus noww

Yeah it’s been happening once a night for us it’s a meme now . We play 4v4 cause it triggers it really quick @Lucidscience  then we all disperse after the warmup/game cancel trigger . Lmfao
And it’s good then: it’s like an account based thing it seems . Legit once a night .... play 12 hours after that no dc
It’s became such a ritual lmfao
@SIX bruhh
Lol cya
Mixer dead
Yeah their marketing team is somethin else . But it comes down to the same thing I say about alllll the twitch streamers that “quit ow” when ANY new game comes out and they’re back under cover on alt accs for the longest time very shortly after and then eventually “come back” to streaming on their mains and such. People don’t like change this day in age . Basically sums it up
No matter what they coulda done (which they didn’t do much and sat on so much opportunity during covid to pop off with mass people sitting at home bored ) ppl don’t like change and twitch ain’t broken so don’t fix what ain’t broken lol. Owl you have to watch using the app to get tokens, can’t get tokens any other way. Thanks YouTube the cheaper option for them that they took last min lol
@Lucidscience
You didn’t have to tell everyone

"Why don't people want to play main tank?" The Devs ask them selves as they add another form of fucking CC to the game.
Oof
I like rein 🙂 idk I guess I don’t feel cc’d to death ever
Unless ur just like a rein god *cough*
The new passive that they introduced makes rein so much more playable then he used to be as far as CC is concerned
what is it
Reduced knockback passive

Truuu
@Cass American? Does the cerb / ei thing in USA not work like it does in Canada o.o? There’s the insurable hours bank and stuff which helps from each pay paying into ei and such but literally end of day right off the top say 1000 is max ei bi weekly , it’s a lump sum so we owe 30% back at tax season; 300 each 1K bi weekly. And then if you claim to much past your banked insurable hours worked at job you owe it all back . I know 1 guy that claimed all winter partying at ice shacks king of ei island sign on his ice shack buncha hillbilly’s and tax season he owed like 8k in ei back lmao!!
You can choose whether they tax it or not but I'm setting some aside far taxes next year

this is how my tank games went with boostio throwing his ass to gold. Had this exact screenshot just with boostio
in gold
4 months away from the game, First Comp game on Tank, 60 elims on Zarya
I'M BACK BITCHES

Still end up in gold though
Lmao that's a goddamn mood

GG @Skeleton Yardel, you just advanced to level 5!
Back to Moira
Ran into a thrower 3 times who had the fucking Blizzcon Winston skin
This guy paid to get banned
My friends acc has everything from every single blizz con skin pink mercy widow noir you name the skin in the game that acc has it I’m so jelly 😦
Blizzcon bastion and Winston so sexy skins
I'm on EU servers
This guy had to go all the way to america for a convention, only to get mass reported for consistently throwing
How little does that mean to him
Couldn’t you just buy the digital ticket for the skins though
I think there's different ones
Cause I got Illidan and tyrande last year but I didn't get a blizzcon skin
Blizzard skins are only obtainable that year
We wiil never get the Bastion or Winston skin unless Blizzard gives it to us again, not even pink Mercy or the OWL skins
yeah I mean the year they came out, I think you could just buy the digital ticket for the winston/bastion one or something
Your winston boi might just be a mom's credit card kinda kid

roooooolled...... how was I not this good BEFORE i took the 40 day break from my PC entirely?
Literally havent held a mouse in what 40 days haha
it took 1 death to realize something was wrong and i fixed it rofl.
@Lucidscience  Soulja boy runnin for OSRS streamer of the year. 2020 is somethin else lol
BX7H3F   got given this replay code from a friend just now. Check out the Widow 'sugardaddy' on the enemy team HAHAHAHA .... if you want a good laugh , lilparkinsons himself at what 1:03 ish onwards will give ya a show .
If you want 10 fps sea sickness and to know what the ground texture / wall textures look like on dorado check out the chocolate milk dude playin bap staring at the floor and bumping into walls 90% of the game. When your bronze and cant make it to even silver WHILE rage hacking baha.
I've seen it all now XD
When u think u have seen it all and then u see something like that...
Just absolute bottom tier bronze with cheats hahahahahaha
Yall’ready know bronze is genetic
^^^^
Its all in the genes baby
Theoretically makes sense cause bronze shouldnt exist when most of the games have actual AI bots in them these days (people coding pocket healers or shit like that) lols.
Id have to pickup a controller havent since idk 2012 and the 360 for halo and shit , reverse the controls like inverted , and close 1 eye with eye patch and drink 12 beer to manage to stay in bronze for longer than 1 day
and im not even great at this game playing at the most ideal standpoint so if i can do all that and still climb outta bronze idk its gotta be genetic
but then again there is koreans in bronze .......
How are u asian and bronze
mindblowing
"convinced this is what tank hero select looks like in most of my games"
AHAH
Pretty much lul
all the easier for shatters 🙂
Eyyyyy
Problem playing rein right now is unless your other tank is on zar , your shields just get bursted and you die
my advise if your shield is getting destroyed too much, is to not use your shield
Very funny young padawan
im the best

> Problem playing rein right now is unless your other tank is on zar , your shields just get bursted and you die

Unless your other tank is six then you can play whatever u want monkey rein whatever

This mans got baited by the same trick like 5 times
@Trashmankind  I'd literally hire you to put me together edited videos and shit for youtube haha.
I would just get clips like this & throw them into a shared one-drive folder between us or give you the replay code whatever works better. Popoff all day everyday and the best ones are the ones where i get the chat screenshot of someone talkin smack and then the footage just dumpstering them lol
I know u do edits u cant lie
XD
Gyazo
LLLL
> I know u do edits u cant lie
@SIX it's funny you should say that, I actually got the loupedeck+ arriving today in the mail lol to help with editing
PogU (2)
Ooooooo
Is that just for pictures mostly?
It’s both. Great for color correction too. I like dials for timeline movement especially. But it has integrations with FCP and After Effects, the main ones I use
You don’t need a ton of color correction on gameplay of course lol, but definitely for everything else
The science fair trailer I had to do some work on color, but that’s cause it needs a more cinematic feel
GG @Trashmankind, you just advanced to level 12!
Definitely something I love about the MacBook Pro is the touchbar, especially for FCP. It just makes it more tactile, easier for fine tuning
Dials are even better
hmmmm
Dude that's sick as fuck
yes, i understand video editing.

2 Million Special: Wagyu A5 Picanha BEST Steak on Earth!
The Best, Most Epic, Most Tasty, Rarest and Most IMPORTANTLY Delicious steak in the world. It's Japanese A5 Wagyu. As a celebration to 2 Million subscribers I was able to get this elusive Picanha A5. Thank YOU from the bottom of my heart, I never thought this would be possible...
Ugh
I can get it (well Japanese A5 Wagyu) at OMO in calgary here but fuck i am rllllllllllllllllllllllllly forcing myself for like 1 yr now not to do it. But considering my Korea/Japan trip got canceled this yr im really tempted lol.............
I wana try it in japan >:)
that looks good
its the best cut of meat in the world lol
I can get BASICALLY similar, just not from the same part of the cow but still Japanese A5 Wagyu but its expensive af at OMO
But i been saying NO lol.
I wana try it in Japan
bro lets get a flight
Not that OMO would rip anyone off with Brandt lake (alberta) wagyu, or AUSSIE wagyu and say its japan
but
I want the true experience in japan lol
I know man 😦
I had a flight lol
damn
Well i had the canada>seoul korea flights
I was gunna buy the japan flight while i was there
its like 100$ if that
Its like 30 mins not even flight
damn
GG @theboos5319, you just advanced to level 1!
Well. Like idk, short af.
Cheap thoooo
true
round trip is like 200$ in advance canadian (Seoul to tokyo). So i mean Id fly to Seoul. Spend 1.5 week there. Fly to Japan. Spend just over a week there, fly back to Korea, spend 2 days there, then fly home. 3 week turnaround. Most the time in Korea though.
still sounds fun ngl
And yall ready know, im doing the POD HOTELS

Basically , directly in line with GREENLAND writing lmao
But yeah... LA.... Florida. And all over canada
Never been EU/ASIA
And it got ruined 😢
never been out of the u.s. mate
going out of USA is easier than going into it
Costed us a lot.
Like LA trip was so expensive......
really
We coulda spent 3 weeks in asia as 4 of us, for the price 4 of us spent 9 days or so in LA
BRUTAL lol.
The CAD>USD and such
and the fact LA is expensive
staying at the hiltion universal
Like we had a 5 min walk to universal, was kinda cool.
But god dang. Even the drinks in the hotel were like 12 bucks

Just play tank if ur sick of getting one shot
i dont like overwattch no more
games bad
thats unlucky
dang
Overwatch will always prevail
it used to be so good
i dont like the fact that you have to choose ur class now
stopped all the god tier strats
it would prevail if they released ow2
is that still happening?
i  think idk antmore
anymore
You don’t like choosing your class? Play open queue 🤷‍♂️
Did you know that exists?
tbh I think role queue was healthy for the game
it was
you would get only dps on open
Js at least the option is there. I prefer role queue as well
But I’m glad you can choose
yea same
Till there is a company to make a 6v6 that’s decent or something alike (not another dead in 2 weeks br) overwatch will always be the go to. Siege is sorta good but it’s camping and cliche as Fuck no go aganes like ow
^^^
there's something to be said about the casual crowd it attracts, makes it feel like I can just have fun and mess around if I want, or go sweaty like in other games
Yeah & i mean siege at this point in the game there is SO much to learn about every operator that you'll need to buy to do well right off the bat, saving up to buy them is a waste of time tbh. Map run outs for spawn peeks / metas and shit you can do with each op each map its just a mess. Also if you get into a game theres nothin more frustrating than literally spawning in & getting raped from a guy doing a runout. Or getting kapkan'd off cooldown
Other than siege idk any sorta game thats like OW in any way
I used to play it a bit with friends who were rlly good at the game so the MMR each game was pretty high especially for me, id run around laying frost mats in just random places and i'd always end up getting SO many people followed by "Literally who the fuck puts a mat there wow" HAAH
same deal if your team won a team fight and only u died, to leave spawn and step in a random junk trap+landmine and die like ????type shit ahha
but ye OW is GOAT
Long story short, OW or bust
Yup
Sadly
hanso pls sweetch
no
hanso never sweitch
THAT POOR MERCY OMG
You wouldnt tell her to switch off widow
:pepoDetective:
Had to .25 her
She LFT top od hitscan @Lucidscience  pick her up
Hahahhaha

*COMBAT ROLL CAN NOW BE DONE MID AIR*
WHAAA
check da experimental changelog
roll distance increased 20%, increased flash duration
Dangg
Sounds like it's high noon to me
So they realized they nerfed cree into the ground and decided to do something about it haha!! ITS HIGH NOOON!
no play genji and deflect
and/or HIGH TIDE LOOOOOL
how much trouble can you get in for using a macro in ow
GG @theboos5319, you just advanced to level 4!
i dont think thats illegal
good good
Are you building a macro that auto-dashes when the cooldown hits 0 for max feeding?
actually no
nevermind lkol
yeah macros are not okay
If so, send the code so I can make a rein insta-pin macro
HAHAHAH
no i use all storm arrows in 0.01 seconds for like monkey or hog
im a long time WoW player and macros are like a part of the game but overwatch is a different story nvm lol
same thing they wont notice beside there health going away
Overwatch macros have to be a 1:1 action. Can’t do one button for multiple things
Ashe slowly getting nerfed into the ground lol
it is kinda lame that the team with the ashe mercy duo, or the ashe mercy players; win 90% of games
but i mean rip ashe she was fun
for example I had a junkrat doom player Tell ya what team won, the hitscan L
avoided & farmed ggez
i have a question for yall xbox x or ps5?
It boils down to exclusives for me
makes sense
Saame
And what all my buddies are getting
nah pc master race
Halo got me to get Xbox but now halo is being more pc compatible so I might not even bother this time
Is halo still ass for pc ? I used to play halo back in 1-2/3/reach/ days and quit at 4 even competed but fuckin halo for pc unless you play on a controller you get raped
It has the most unbalanced aim assist ever
Like a 5 year old could play on a controller and wax SUMMIT1G all day I was watching it happen lmfao
Haven’t bought the steam ports so I don’t know. I played halo 1 on pc and it was good then lol
I think infinite will work natively
I've played a couple of the halo games on pc and theyre completely fine for me
But I had also never played halo in the past so
Also my bf and I are getting a ps5 for like God of War and spider man and final fantasy
I just tried overwatch with controller on alt
Shits impossible
you should check my nipple gameplay
Lucidscience on hitscan should be a reportable offense
@Trashmankind
I wana see lucid 1 trick widow for a season on a freshy

More body shots than a swimsuit calendar
i have a wido hs only and i play that with ppl and he was clapping cheks
Cause he holdin down aim key
:KEKW:
nice
He got dat triggerbot
true
I’ve literally went against aimbot every time I try and play a dps game on my OG acc it’s kinda fucked lol. I told friend like duo with me and I’ll do a dps placement and I know for a fact we will encounter a hacker - sure as shit we did today lmfao
Was rolling him with his hacks to which was funny
But then he went full rage . Like he tracking through walls and shit blatant af lol
Can you guess what level he and his mercy pocket were lol
like 30
man you take a long time to type
I just got my alt pc I built ages ago and left at my fams home but never used it - I was like bruh I am so tempted to install ow on it as all the parts are new no HWID is linked to me at all- I’ll use a separate landline and router even and vpn ofc. Buy a freshy off someone so my paypal ain’t linked to that shit from blizz like totally off the radar. Get some cheats . Go play normal but when I encounter a full blown confirmed hacker like only if it’s fully confirmed and blatant then I am gunna become the anti hack police and just give him top 500 game sens with better hacks lolllll
Ya he was lvl 30 ish
Imagine the reactions of your teammates lmfao
“DATS IT IM SICK OF THESE HACKWRS IM GOING FULL RAGE”

Couple more wins in OD for @Lucidscience might get lucky and pickup hub as a sponsor that would be so clean jerseys with fuckin PH icon . Before each game or clip montage you need to put the PH intro in
Maybe if I get time should come up with a meme ph jersey for drip with PH theme lmfao

@Lucidscience
cheating?
time stamp
R U CHEATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTING
wtf lol no thats the fake Lucid
hes like 4.3k peak hitscan
FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM
Alt acc andy over here bein sus
Kapp
nopee
You wana know whats awkward bout that clip
Unless high view count streamers are in the game that report early in the game. This shit never fucking happens haha. Whitelist and who see's it/acts on it fast enough. Emongg is to report instant and some blizz temp/fuckin intern w/e dog shit they got running the report system catches it and isnt jerking off in the shitter- it might cancel. If not gg
fuckin interns coop students fuckin dog shit anti cheat team
:KEKW:
"but we cant ban instantly even if we know theyre cheating and add them to the ban wave list, we need to have them use multiple accs so we can not only chain ban ALL their accs but also hit many many ppl not just a handful before cheat provider patches their cheat"
Bruhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ahhahahahahahaahhahaahhahahahahahahahaha what an excuse for our teams dog shit.com
It’s kinda fucked that 75% of your games have a cheater in them whether it’s blatantly obvious or suuuuuuuuuuper super slight just enough to not be called out but enough to rig the mmr 50/50 shit we all know exists - I call it the igvault 11 dollar recovered in 7 days special. When you don’t want a freshy cause that’s obvious your already auto reported loading into a game 247- but a 3 star or silver border they will recover 9/10 times in 7 days
Or chingchong special etc lmao
I just report every dps player I go against these days and I get emails almost daily and I haven’t seen a blatant hacker in so fucking long it’s crazy
Kindaaaaaa fucked ngl
So there’s an owner and an ai named the same thing running around in qp atm
The ai is so bad though it’s gotta be earlyearly stages
Wtf lol
N2GPPN
Guess who the ai is lol
Kinda cool though ngl
*nipple pad
ffs
NIPPLE PAD OR BUST
Yeah where the nipple at
Nice bait but Lucid already told me 10000x no more NSFW in the general nice bait trashmang
I was gunna post some nipple
:PeepoSadBlanket:
Imagine leveling your freshies in qp & talkin hard.... Wow..... Whole new level of tide pod eaters there. I can't remember the last time i didnt ahk an acc...jesus... I guess when your 13 n cool with the 6 stack of boys you got the time to eat tide pods and que qp and tryhard/talk tough but get rolled LUL. Jesus NA east has some wirdchamps rofl
I wish I could select my home West server and wait 100 yrs for a que instead of play that trailer trash east coast
Right off the bat i can name a few here we go whatdowegot, The early-mornin-free-sr-special, beeftipsy valkia duo. Uhhhhhhhh daniel fenner, fuck who else moreweth evil toaster, who else i think its harder to name who isnt a joke on east coast than who is east & a joke rofl. Noone plays ow for elo anymore i hope
Goteem hehe
EAST COAST BEAST COAST BABY
eviltoaster moreweth tank line valkia beeftipsy dps line and Danielfenner and some other meme support  east coast beast coast is right :KEKW:
If your lucky you might get a junkrat or a bastion OTP replacement

:PeepoSadBlanket:
In the ow news channel they fixed a bug where add a friend button disappears when using a controller on pc? That’s a bug? That should be a thing ffs lmfao
Who want a friend on controller
✅
:KEKW:
Just qued 3 games , 3940 support starting Sr. 70 games played since placing 3900, peaking 3990s and never being below 3900 solo qued always - (already weird considering my alt is 4.3 without issues in 30 games ish) this acc is hella flagged I guess to be forced loss and hard stuck 3900s because I got 3 insta ques ranging from 3.5 flat 3.7 flat and a 3.8 game against 3 different cheaters in stacks
Matter of 45 mins lost 3 games
hahahahahahahahajajhajahahahahahaha
Guess I’ll just play my OG acc for fun and not Sr till it’s maybe not flagged idk . Crazy that my alts all climb with same percentiles as I’m the same fuckin player from hopping acc to acc yet this ones hella hard stuck oof
hahHHH
Crazy man haha
yes unlucky
I hate ow elo system
Let me bend over so they can stick it in me dry
takes years to get out of a rank
They are so painfully obvious flagging this acc cause I got sooooo many accs all going well into gm easily
And this ones just sittin in 3.9 sup like a retard hahaha
yeah well that sucks
Problem is with low player base up here
It’s painfully obvious the systems rigging games
Gives me diamond tanks at 3950 elo
Rllllly fam lmao
Meanwhile enemy team is all Smurf’s cheating stacked
damn
sounds a l9t like siege
The game should just say your acc is flagged until X time
Cause it’s obviously flagged
Idk why either
what does flagged mean
Forced losses and to hold it below gm on support
80 games *
In 3900 support
Never dropped below till now
Imagine 78 games 3900 placed 3994 peak never dropped below 3900
I got 78 games combined across 3 alts all in 4.1-4.3
With ease
What’s the problem with this acc rofl
idk
ow being dicks
i wish i was a hot babe
and could go find and become fuck buddies with a tech guy at blizz for ow
just to see if the accs flaggd
lmao I'm out for dinner atm so I'm gonna have to go
or confirm low priority que
etc
have a good one
9B64GW go watch this ashe/widow especially on downtown wallhack and aim key his ass off in qp LMAO then talk shit at end of game
downtown is funny hes tracking through like 4 walls hahahaha
7:50 is good especially widow grapple
HAHAHA downtown map
hes hard walling in quickplay
thats insane
HARD WALLING IN QUICKPLAY OMEGALOOL WHAT A GAME
Look at the game sense on this mans
Imagine being so good when you legit wake up and hop on, tired as fuck- that u make kids rage hack in qp to win.....
I legit couldnt even open my eyes while my coffee was being made roflll..... Theres the tldr clip but i recommend the full replay 😄
umm something happend

Higher elo don’t always mean better teammates like imagine the guys that get lucid on their team the poor fuckers hahahaha jkjk
Yeah imagine getting six on dps on ur team #autoloss
LOL
It’s like the flats mccree emongg mercy
Hahahha
My dps kinda slaps though recently
Turning into a widow OTP fuck

POG on Havana was nuts
Bored of Ashe though she’s just to easy at low elos lol
Haha ye
ez boost
We evaded the hook pull with that bob
And then just farmed
6 Stack in Open Queue and force GOATS?????????
ewww
They didn’t run goats
I see your smurf stats
And raise you 1 report
LOL
For not breaking any rule just My ass chapped
we didnt lube them 1st
How’s it smurfing if the acc never placed before in open que
:weSmart:
lolz
5000 IQ loophole
Casual 9-1 placement
ez boost
On controller
yo yo yo
For sure is heavily MMR based. Went 7-2-1 on my mains placements and placed 3200 lol
and hermorah with the gold
Doesn’t make sense the acc I bought way back was bronze all 3 roles . I climbed to like mid- high silver all 3 roles ALL W though... 7-1-2
3800? Ish
i played 1 game open q last season
And def didn’t have these kinda stats
The game musta gave us the best it could tho
There’s no way I could do any better than I did
facts
@EXT1NCT1ON u still watching mate
Every game potg p much . Golds ofc by a mile . Just taking a shit and I’m coming back

9-1 celebration shit . So we won 1-2 normal comp or more?
Today

six i am gana do some geni blade
1 kill blade
erz
I’m do Ans widow
I'm 1-0 in Diamond Open Queue
0-2 Gold Tank Role Queue
3-1 Plat Tank Role Queue
Gold is a mess LOL
At the end of season this acc easily will have enough tokens for golden so it needs tracer golden. Then when anniversary comes around pay to unlock graffiti tracer so I can play tracer lol
For some reason I can only use that skin on tracer idk
Gold is a mess ye
I must have a 95% winrate on @theboos5319  alt acc
Lmao
We rarely lose games
facts
And shit it’s like plat tank , plat sup, nearly 2200 dps and all I’ve done mostly is dps
Takes ages to climb it
From 1400? Lol
bro i went from 1300 to 1800  i am boosted
Nah we went 9-1 in high plat
And your hanging ez
Ashe just kinda EZ
lolz

EZZZZZZZ

Sometimes it do really be like that
EXT1NCT1ON YT
Tanking in Diamond vs Plat vs Gold
Elo Hell is real
(The diamond is open queue btw, for sure not role queue)
Definitely isn’t Lucid playing ashe on extinction acc
GG @SIX, you just advanced to level 13!

@Nuvalin does the tin man have a sheet metal cok

Let’s say a bronze decided he was gunna play dps only
3000-25 =2975 ok. 15 for a win 5 for a tie... that’s like 200wins needed at 50/50 that’s 400 games rofl

ELON
not Elon silly, this is the famed Nikola Tesla, the man that was far beyond his time.
Tesla Bowie
The company Tesla was named in his honor
Elon Musk is just the big brained tech entrepreneur that made that company a reality
Tbf if you watch documentary’s on Elon you’d be surprised the man hasn’t gone off the deep end early in life or now even, only thing keeping him going now is the success and wanting to do as much change and cool shit as he can but man looking at family members who do reallllllly well for them selves they are grey hair at their mid 30s with money all over the place on projects and Shit I can only imagine Elon lmao
elon musk changed the tesla price to 69,420
any 69ers

It’s so weird I played my buddies Xbox 1 not long ago and man I know it’s controller and I used to be half decent on 360 but haven’t touched a controller since dabous was still in his dads bag but damnnnn it feels like the games slower idk not just the inputs but like coming from a high refresh rate monitor on high fps with pc , console just makes me sick after a match like actual motion sickness sick/headache idk
Shoutout to all the console players out there lol I can’t do it
That’s the big time issue with 240hz
You don’t notice much from 144-240
But play that 240 for a week and try and go backwards
Then re evaluate your difference statement lol
Even watching tv is fucky for me idk

Why do people skip hanamura ? It’s a snowball map
I’ve seen some nutty shit go down on top left B lmao
Did you ever hear the tragedy of HughMungus? I thought not. It's not a story the OWL casters would tell you. It's a tank legend. HughMungus was a tank main, so powerful and so wise he could use his shield to influence the DPS to do their jobs.
He had such a knowledge of the shields that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The tank mains of the game is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was getting banned for toxicity, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice reported him to blizzard in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.
M8 you good
No
M8 aint you in school
Yeye
Thats amazing hahaha thanks for that legendary piece @EXT1NCT1ON !!!! :Lucid5BigHuge: 🥲

But dope setup for sure @Hermorah !!
We need a overwatch rap or Canadachill rap ASAP by my buddy video incoming @Lucidscience
He said he would rap on my mic mid time if I drop a beat which I can with my stream deck
You heard my stream deck meme shit I can drop a whole beat with it
Sounds like the song would . Audio cabled right
Not like mic to speaker shit
@Lucidscience
Imagine this on mid time lol or end of game
Overwatch style tho
big bars loool
Yep lol
Want anything? Austin TMS YouTube socials bro
Just don’t go asking who his co worker is that’s what I’m worried about Canadachill doing I told him just don’t leak me if I want my name leaked I’ll do it lmfao
He knows lol
I mean you know it but others that wana support him with a follow ya same shit right

Yeah @Hermorah  lets hear it me and @Nuvalin  wana hear it good or bad we pumpedddd
Like my buddy is good but it’s not his full time thing it’s just a hobby he has for the last 15 years he’s 27 . Like the amount we game and do other sht he has 1 hobby basically lmao. So I mean raps alright but end of the day even ppl that hate rap woth a passion like our old supervisor respects it and likes his stuff lolll.
I wouldn’t wana throw 15 years into a hobby to rap decent tell ya that lollll
And make beats and midi type stuff
Just gunna hire him to jump on the mic while I play ow lmao. Half time raps etc
what
I cant rap worth shit like hermorah lol. I was saying friends got 15 yrs into that as his only hobby basically to be that decent and he was hammered there hes better sober ofc lmao. I wouldnt even try to start to rap considering how long it takes to get good rofl.
@Nuvalin

Probably he’s just hiding his skill

I can only imagine his tunnel mindset. "I GOT U RIGHT WHERE I WANT U I KNOW UR ON THAT MINI" and winds up a punch to punch the wall . Straight bamboozled idiot lol
Bap needs to die and retire/go to ow2. Imagine having a hero that builds an IMAX thats legit double dmg, in half a team fight. Thats got an ABILITY COOLDOWN that trumps a Zen ULTIMATE. Imagine having an ult thats not as good as an ability. Also having insane mobility, imax screen every fight. Insane output for dps and heals. Like its the same concept as putting mike tyson in the ring against @theboos5319
Bap shouldnt have a lamp. or lamp should be his ult. Or he needa go in general- then we can play dive. If you dont like dive you should be playing games like osrs , minecraft, solitare, my little pony etc
Gettin sick of imax screens blowin my teams asshole inside out every push, lamps LOS'd cant take dmg, or shielded as bap enables double shield, him having ability to legit do rollouts with his jump that has no cooldown and charges so fast
nah m8 i would fuck up mike tyson 🤣
Yeah ud grab his dik and twist it
lol s

Enjoy Dick Twisting
bro that comp game lol
@Lucidscience  Imagine having dog shit supports 14 odd games ina row in masters and ending the same sr as started that many games later in mid mast
legit got 1000 sr on these kids both us for the most part, and duo tank synergy and we got animal supports HAHA
Every game
its just whatever game we win, the dps are gapping enemy dps enough to make it thru
Hows everyone a dog on support in master? Thats cray
I afk on mercy and go 3.9-4k in like an afternoon every season p much.
Its not that hard LOL
m8 having the same prob
Only way to climb as tank in low-mid mast once u fall there is to slow the que time down so you arent insta filled into swing matches. You NEED a higher sr duo on dps ideally, if not support. Duo tank wont work either. Youll just get insane swings most the time. Pretty avg enemy team across the board VS 2 john cenas on tank & 4 nose pickers that eat it
Go read forums for competetive on bnet site- go read any external high traffic ow comp forums online. Youll see SO many talking about it. Blizz changed something in the last 3 weeks that has to do with the match making system but instead of slowly turning it up they went full blown pepega. I think its something to do with them bein put on blast not long ago for their player base active accs etc numbers they tried boasting about. Now they makin ques say "fugggg it lool put this guy with this guy ahahah quick ques hella population" when in reality noone is stupid- the games are terrrrrible 90% the time
algorithm = team 1 wins unless some FLUKE accident happens like ur cat chews your ethernet cable for the first time in its life. It probably tracks ur avg fps, dc rate, ranks you in a pma to toxic tier "low priority que list" , puts u on the team with the players who main and have best winrate and percentiles on TOTAL counter picks vs enemy team OR same hero pools but waaaay better percentiles aka the typical 1 widow shits on the other all game gg next type shit.
They wont release the algorithm. "its copywrite, itll be stolen"
Bitch whos gunna steal this algorithm. Lets be fuckin real. LMAO
I wish the game was like it was back in the seasons 2-7. It’s gone so downhill since. This is my last tryhard season and I’m ready to just settle 4K all roles and 4K open que at best and call it a day as if corona virus stuff shapes up in the new year or work just says fuck it and starts sending us up north again hard - Ima be grinding till I move home in the spring and buy house ideally/ start my own company etc and I will never have time for ow unless it’s the odd night of qp for absolute casual fun and I won’t even be 1 bit upset bout it lol
Community was way better back then too
They just need to add 2 options . I’d rather wait longer for my home server . I’d rather wait longer for +/- 50 Sr average games . The server options in custom game you can set which servers priority why can’t we have the option for comp? 🙂
There is qp classic why not comp classic (open que is farrrrrr from comp classic dudes)? Imagine that? In 2 seconds I’ve came up with 3 ideas that are 10000 times better than anything they’ve done in the last 2 years . Hire me blizz
bro y'all typing like 9 paragraphs
today me and my friends said the n word, I said nig and they said the other part
teamwork at its finest
Yep blizz is dog shit there’s no way to que as solo or duo master tank and not have 3/4 your games be with ai and have to do the job of fuckin 4 ppl to win the game . I’ve literally turbo inted 4.4 games and just existed amongst owl players and had 0 value but a distraction and won games wtf is this sht I’m pissed

How to use priority psss?
I think it automatically uses it
but ptr showed the manual option to use it or not lol
They changed it w/o telling us?
comp has its own priority pass system seperate from qp as well just fyi
So my theory of banking more than 1, lvling a fresh 1-25 acc, then using em all in comp wont work for that reason and the reason that i guess they dont stack
qp dps <12 mins it said so lets test ig
got put into a backfill at the final .2 sec of a game: didnt use pass, but now i got <5 min priority re que but still isnt using pass
this is broken
wait is 40/40 40 passes or 1 pass?
oh its 40 passes lol
Ah they only work in groups
it promps me to use it whilst trying a duo here
Finna get turnt new ffa map in ptr let’s get this connolly holy moly

Hows the new map?? @Trashmankind

@Lucidscience  To bad I am away but whats this 4v4 tournament? Are they trying to say that EVERY team, will have the option to have 2 OWL players play on it?
Tournament Details
Signups begin January 15 and extend until January 21. Matches will be held on January 22 - 24 using the GameBattles tournament platform.
All matches will be played in the 4v4 Team Deathmatch format.
Two (2) Overwatch League players will be eligible to compete per team, and only two can play on a team at any given time.
Prizes:
The Overwatch League is hosting regional tournaments, each with their own $10,000 prize pools.
Two (2) Overwatch League players will be eligible to compete per team, and only two can play on a team at any given time.
they almost make it sound like only two can be in the entire tourny, but they *could* be on the same team lol
but knowing their grammar issues in the past, I wouldn't be surprised if the second part of that rule is completely redundant
Ive officially heard it all. Police coming on radio basically said. Do not even think about calling in as a concerned canadian about covid worried "someone" *ironicalllllly your ex spouse* might be having people over. You will be fined and arrested.
YALLL ready know that was 500000% directly aimed at the female population because no dude cares, ever. It's some salty bitches that the dude thats dumped them is bangin someone else HAHAAH.

Hanzo dont need burst dmg tanks dont need more burst dmg this games so fucked why cant they buff hanzo in a way he can duel dps / long range dps duel not burst tanks lmao these devs are on the longest recovery from coke sniffing ive ever seen just braindead judgement on what the game needs
i like how ow is just a hard beta for a pve fucking game theres no other explanation to why the devs try retard level shit ALL the time. Lets cater to the MMO andys that will jerk off to PVE whilst ruining the game. Pogu
sniper or shredder idfk zzzz
Bring back scatter shot pussies
I second that @Cass 😂
WHAT IF instead of scatter shot, they use the valorant single shot that bounces, and maybe it does something like blows up or spawns 10 mini torb turrets
Or something along the theme of his ult that goes through the map. What if it's a single piercing shot that goes through everyone, but can still be blocked by a shield
ow has turned into such a shitty game

I might get it and play tomorrow night
Lmk what u think of it
is fun and good
10/10 reccomend
Sarcasm or do you actually mean that? I cant tell if you enjoyed playing it with us or not
@Stinkmother
@Unknown not sarcastic its fun! i like multiplayer it makes the game easier lel
Yeah for sure
I tried playing solo and it kinda sucked
yeah i played solo today and it was kinda boring
also i unlocked 2 of the other characters and they suck
which 2?
what colors are they
engi and merc
the white & purple one?
the merc is blue i think
the engi is purple/green i cant remember
I like the turret one, cause you can get mushrooms which allow your turrets to heal everyone if you stand next to them & they can stack healing
theres no blue character
oh lol
Purple, yellow, red, orange and white
the one with the sword
ohhhh
yeah
the blue one
forgot about that dipshit of a character
the genji one
never played that one, it just looks like too much effort
yeah
no long range
My favorite one is theyellow one
bad
robot is ok
i like huntress
has the amazing dps witht he nail hun, then you can press R and swap it out to sniper mode
you can also carry 2 Q abilities
fucking auto aim scrub
smile

what did you guys DO
Trashmans design
those poor dolphins
ethical treatment 😃
youve convinced me to make me purchase of the game immediately
what is ip @J1ngl3
@Unknown
whats your minecraft name?
also please dont destroy anyones place
Vav_NOT_Vav
im not a monster
do you have ftb?
idk what that is
ooo okay, ill set you up with it tomorrow. Its too late for brains now
scroll up and install the FTB launcher tohugh
I linked it earlier
it says it requires a java thing
yeah
get 64bit
idk what that means but i can figure it out tomorrow
Someone whos in the server can help you
ill whitelist your name so you can join when they've got everything working for you
okiedokie
Did you see the entrance
There's so much more to do...so many more business opportunities for this flower in the desert
ok its daytime someone help me
i want 2 mindcraft
Download the FTB launcher a few messages above
the java thingy
Yeah..run it and it's a mod manager like nexus
owo ok
Within it install infinity evolved I think it's called
And also go to options and tell me what the max ram you can set to is
options in minectraft or in java thing
If the max is 1.5gb then you need to install 64 bit Java, not 32 bit
In Java thing
You don't need to open minecraft, this will handle that now
Also log into your account from this app on the bottom right I belive
I'm not at my computer so Im going off memory atm 😮
it says detected 64bit
Ok that's good, raise the ram to something above 10gb or whatever you can
idk how to do that
There's a bar
You can slide it to increase
ok i officially have ftb installed

To activate, a conduit needs to be in the center of a 3×3×3 area of water (source blocks, flowing water, and/or waterlogged blocks), which itself must be enclosed within an activation frame. The frame is built up of blocks in three 5×5 open squares centered on the conduit, one around each axis. Only prismarine, dark prismarine, prismarine bricks and sea lantern blocks in the frame contribute to activation. A minimum of 16 blocks are required, and produce an effect range of 32 blocks. Prismarine-type slabs (including double slabs) and stairs cannot be used to activate the conduit.
Working on a 1.14.2 survival island server..do you want the island to have a village? Or totally bare bones

Plus Idk if raids will happen cause that's in 1.14
Where villages are attacked by pillagers

:)))) also I built something 4 David ;))))
uh oh
a surprise tool well use later ;))))
does it have anything to do with forest fires
No ;))))
ok good ahahahaaa
we'd hate to have that happen again
yes forest fires are dangerous and should be prevented
yes whoever starts one should be jailed for life
they should receive the death penalty
and a $50,000 fine
and their children turned over to the government for labor
and all of their possessions sold in auction
and the death penalty is a 360 no-scope headshot fatality with tactical tea-bag
followed by a “gg ez”
followed by their nan saying "sit"
and then an account ban
omg that's almost too far
i found the buried treasure :)_
oh nice what was in it
the heart of the c?
yeah
and i found another sunken ship lol
the ship is coming from INSIDE THE ISLAND
i found another village
you're too far!!
come back
its not actually that far
yeah only 20,000 leagues
i saved them from a raid
OH FUCK I DIED
welp
rip
i lost my diamond pickaxe and sword :)
and an emerald
oh well
just go back??
jingle said stuff despawns after 5 min
it will take me longer than that to get there
uh oh
how do i make my own server
don't ask questions like that
oh ok
u must become hacker 2.0 first
oh 2 hard
a vindicator killed you?? wtf is that
"sounds dangerous" -pharah
hurt
how did u know that
:)))))))))))
oh ok :)
i can manage the server remotely, like turn it off/restart or see the console that says what you died to
ooooh
fancy
vindicator was a raid boss
ohh, thats the 1.14 stuff, never seen them before
wonder why we didnt see them on the main island
i did see them
on the main one??
when i logged on this worning t here were 3
yeah i killed them
oh wow that's cool
no villagers though so they had nothing to pillage
we need to repopulate the village and build protection for them eventually
yes
im literally trapped in jingles stupid mine bc my pickax ran out and i put stairs UNKNOWING THAT THERES ANOTHER BLOCK OF SPACE THEY NEED TO WORK SO I CANT GO UP THEM WITHOUT MINING
Do you need help 😦

my mouse keeps getting stuck
the rolly ball thingy is weak
how would one fix that
Buy a mouse from the 21st century without a roller ball thingy
It’s a razor mouse
I don’t mean the rolly ball on the top I beam the tiny one on the bottom that detects movement
Mean
clean the underside where the laser is
THERES A LASER?
unless theres a ball in the mouse, it'll have some form of laser
I don’t think mine has a laser
Is it a Microsoft mouse from 1996?
It’s a Razor Mamba
Looks like a laser to me
Ok so I just like clean the bottom of it
Just wipe the dust and shit away from the underside of it
yeah
Ok thanks I’ll try that
See if that fixes it
Was there anything else you needed help with today ma'am?
No thanks :) I’ll write a nice review on yelp Mr. Geeksquad

You can play for totally free with the link below on your smartphone.

I assume from the writing, but who knows
It’s a national holiday
Neat
I want pasta now
Noodles are FOREVER
maybe some chicken fried brow, and then slow cooked the rest of the way in tomato sauce
and a metric fuck ton of mozz and parm
Always mozz
yo
Boar's Head smoked cheddar though
with pasta
its like a cheesy campfire
Take me on a pasta journey
This sucks...
I can roll my own pasta and it will take some much work
or I can eat boxed dilanti
I WANT
TORTELLINI

And also some feta mixed in
I prefer goat cheese myself
Goat cheese is gross 🤢🤢🤢

assist i think
could it mean an assist?
hmm, ive never seen it before
ususally dont see it but i know it tracks it
me neither
maybe they just added it
brb adding my 293472394 assist tracker
Assists for ranked that way you get points. They added it just after season 3.
ohh wonder why it's not in casual
Y'all sweaty
ahhh ok
my armpits are sweaty if you wanna sniff
Yeah people were getting points for kills with 5 damage and some people weren't with 1k damage so they added it
so when are they gonna stop people from avoiding losing points by just leaving lol
They pushed that fix like 3 months ago and it never worked lol
lol just gave up that's fine
Sounds like an overwatch patch tbh
overwatch has zero bugs! It just works

Damn Overwatch gets me ever time
Games fine untill the team gets tilted or gulls full autistic
Rant complete. Back to Apex
overwatch is pain
overwatch is life
OW is death
overwatch is an experience
at the end of the day, that's al you can say
Like we're trapped in spawn with 6 man in discord and ppl still cant wait the 4 secs to group up like wtf
hahahhahahh
I know that feel
OW is a trial of patience
I need to never six stack with ppl i know are bad
its a step towars becoming a jedi knight
Its  astep towards the dark side and not the cool one
also, you could use bad sixstacks as an opportunity
to learn something you really bad at
Yet playing that game expecting anything other than a shit show any more is seemingly impossible
You cant learn if you cant walk out of the spawn door
that's step one
most ppl fail that
it hurts pee pee
Ima reset, smoke, and Hit up aPex

an entire fucking game of civ
'yes cass it's been 4 hours'
my mind has never been so blown
i was comfy as hell
4 hours? SCRUB
I think we did 4 hours last night lol
I am totally down for civ on a night where I'm not feeling poop y

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/431292613866291212/670104196657446952/image0.jpg
oof I honestly like civ V wayyyyyyyyy more
I know what you mean..I like 5 a lot too but there’s certainly way more dimensions to the game now
I think that's part of why I don't like it as much, after V had all its DLC come out it had like a perfect balance of complexity and board game simplicity
but VI feels like it has so many more systems, my dumb monkichi brain can't handle it
but I'll play anytime just tag me in
lol I get it. I disable particular ones if I really don’t feel like dealing with it. I’m super agro and love war but @Stinkmother likes religious victory and ambassador/loyalty/city state things
I’ve played civ since civ 2 which was basically war or science lol
what's your favorite
I tend to lean towards either IV BTS or V
civ fun
easy difficulty = for me, stupid
I think 4 is a perfection of 1-3. While 5 was the most different and hard to compare. I do think in 4 my civilization felt like a cohesive nation, but 5-6 it’s more of a bunch of independent city management. There’s a lot more replayability after 5 though because of how leader abilities work
I miss being able to walk into an empty city lol..civ 2

Rhea’s boisterous bottom is only matched by her juicy, unholy hips. I would get down on both knees and willingly worship and offer my life to the goddess Sothis if only for a chance to get a grip on those captivating curves I crave so much. It’s an absolute fucking crime that the archbishop has a booty that’s so fucking bodacious, knowing that a woman of the Goddess is bound from sharing her assets with the world. Truly, the ass is to blame. We must eliminate the church so that one day we will be able to put our unworthy limbs onto those thick thighs that we have been denied.

@Stinkmother u may have already seen this but just in case
anyone have time to redpill me on Risk of Rain2
AHHHHHHH
GOOD GAME
many of us own it :)))
Last update added a final boss so there’s an ending if you choose. Otherwise you can “dungeon crawl” as long as you like. There’s tons of bosses and mini quests, no limit to anything. Item customization can get wacky like in binding of isaac
I have monies to spend
There’s a big neutral start customization, lots of heroes with different abilities, and their abilities can be customized by unlocking new things
Blah blah blah I think it’s well worth the price
What I don’t like is how money and items aren’t shared. Your teammates need to agree to be fair. There’s mods that fix it though 🙂 but it’s not a huge issue, we’re all kind to each other
_mostly_
word
Might be a choice

@J1ngl3 i got valorant key
u been watchin
eh
i watched a little
if i got a key i dont think i would even play
shame
Have to watch for 2 hours to be eligible for a key anyway
ohh
you can stop watching all Valorant streams after the 2 hours, the keys drop to random people that have 2 hours watch time
watch time doesnt have to be on only one stream, you can swap between streamers
You could have a key drop to you 4 days after watching a stream, its totally random apparently
They said if you’re one of those who watched like 200 hours they would be accommodating as well
200 hours 😮
ive probably "watched" like just over 2 hours
just playing it on my laptop without actually watching it lmao
I struggle to watch it, looks so boring to me
yea
in other news? Echo is live? does that mean I have to play OW again
I didnt even realise
alvin says hes been watching streams for 4 days still no key
game looks like shit anyways hehe
Maybe it's a sign
I’ve had it running for 8 hours a day since the beta started lol
It's not meant to be it would seem

Ima get risk of rain next
it is good but still needs that final boss feel that risk of rain 1 had
there are "final" bosses in it right now but you have to do a lot of things to progress to them, they're not entirely lore final, they're just separate activities to do along the way
there's still a lot of stuff to do and it's like 99% feature-full
lot of stuff, as in it has many many things for a player to do in game
:chin: but i must fill tum tum with yum yum and later i will get it ohn

@Ron Swanson
again lol
bruh big brain he playing apex and ow at the same time
juicy
u like gunfire?
yeah it;'s interesting
repetitive though i think
when grinding levels
lawl
shurukins are awesome thouigh
easily my fav
yuzzz
literally beat the first boss with only shurukins in 30 seconds
he was only able to summon once
NICE
Bruh, Gunfire matchmaking is good and the ping isnt so bad untillll you try a damn jumpy puzzle at 160ms.
I almost quit on that lvl 3 water one
Pretty sure it’s client hosted mini servers. Even when you do singleplayer
@Ron Swanson u wanna slam
:come:
@Trashmankind i wanna slam
come on and
Japan
Got one more to buy Gunfire lol
OK SO... Its not trashmans internet
we just cant do east to west caost
ahhh i hosted and he said it wasnt so bad sooo
idk now
dang they changed the elite maps
now they have boulders on the second stage and some of the stage one stuff is diff
Hmmmmmnm
I think if I vpn it will be better, will try next time
Hong Kong aws btw west coast hahaha
@Unknown what vpn do you use. I had a $1 for a year thing that’s ending with VPNArea and I’d like to switch
thats not a boulder
its a ROCK
I was using WTfast for overwatch. It's expensive and was gonna switch to one a streamer recommended but don't remember what it's called
yaaaa @Trashmankind i was thinken a vpn would solve the problem 100%
@Unknown "Haste" is a good one I used that was like 100$ for a whole year
Free month trial too
the thing with Gunfire reborn is the Host is messed up when we play east and west
@Trashmankind Sea of thieves is now on steam, if i get it would you like to play it?
Heck ya dude..wait is it cross compatible with Microsoft
I own the Microsoft store version
lemme check
Oh heck yeah I just looked now
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/431292613866291212/717856610944286813/image0.jpg
yeh
fuck yeah lemme know if you wanna play it later
Last I played it’s a super chill game though, AMAZING water graphics. Some objectives to do but it’s a great game to just sail around and see what happens haha
ive heard great things about it xD
I never progressed much because back when it came out it was a super nasty grind and only one raid, but I’m sure there’s way more now
yeah i was about to say theres a lot now
The quests sucked because it’d be “go dig this treasure 30 minutes away” for like 1xp haha
“Do that 483762 times”
yeah there's a grind still. but it seems more fun now
I hope so! At the very least it’s just so pretty to simply....sail around ya know
yeah :D
@Stinkmother IT KICKED ME OUT
WHAT
OH MY GOD I FORGOT I WAS HOSTING
OH MY GOD IM SO SORRY
aAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I hate you
IM SORRY
;-;
IM SO SOORRRYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
i was destined to win
did u still get ur essence?
now you gotta eat like a loser

:(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
ya ofcourse
@Trashmankind wanna do see of feefs after dinner? :D
14/50gb gotta be kidding me
I am angered
;-;
we can play another time then, keep downloading though ;c
Yeah 😦 is not half way yet
id be faster if some one sent a usb Fedex
There’s a big rainstorm rn and I’m surprised my power didn’t go out either
hope the internet gods favor you some more then
@Trashmankind @J1ngl3 minecarttft
@AMONG US TWERK THURSDAY 50mb/s not bad but i forgot it's a 50gb huge game haha
@Ron Swanson So from what I can tell Haste doesn't allow you to select servers to route to, all it does is "improve" ping to the server you're on (which in my case gave me 5ms more than I would get not using it). Like I need to route to NA West to be able to play on North American servers
yup no options on that bad boi
rip
Its good for only removing lag induced by your isp imo
all it did was make my ping higher 😂
Ya then its not for you
went from 49ms to 55ms
with haste enabled
Used it in Alaska cause my ISP was adding 40 ms for whatever reason shortly after changing carriers. Haste removed it. A VPN tho will always increase your ping in optimal conditions
Its just tunneling software and that packing and unpacking process adds lag. If haste didnt shorten your travel route then another vpn wont either.
THE ONE THING you can optimize is your DNS server possibly. Even that wont be night and day different tho. Google DNS optimizer.
https://code.google.com/archive/p/namebench/
Your current packet route could be hitting an overlaoded DNS server and changing your DNS hosts might help a bit
Yeah, for Overwatch as an example: In OCE we play on the Americas server but they have oce servers within that that give us lower ping. When I play with you guys I vpn to na west to get lower ping (usually 140 instead of 210 without the vpn). Thats what I thought Haste did
AHhhhhh
Does yoru router support tunneling?
No idea
There's some technical things you can do with your router and stuff but if your not familiar with that stuff it can cause more problems.
I could probably do it, but I dont want to change everyones connection in the house. Only mine when im actually playing Overwatch, thats the only game I vpn with
Ya. Odds are in figuring out the techno bugs you cause your house havoc with the network connection. I drove my family nuts for about a year playing around with 3rd party router software.
hahaha
@Ron Swanson down to play some not overwatch games?

@Ron Swanson @Trashmankind let me know if yall wanna play borderlands
borderlands you say?
OWO
is thottrap interested perhaps
me and ariel have two
and all the dlc
basement does too
HMMMMMMMMM
i think we would be playing 2? bc david never finished it
I’ve never played 2 and don’t have it. How much is it?
I’ve played all of 1
base game on steam is 20 bucks
idk we can ask david what he wants to play
i dont think hes played 1
I haven’t played any but 2
I guess I don’t have a preference. Though my Saturdays are most often booked :0
we need to PLAN
wait until summer sale
it will be like 20 for all dlc, game
and maybe even presequel
summer sale is in like one week
also, buy tabletop sim
I got Borderlands 3 on the epic store. Haven’t played it more than 30 mins
3 sucks peen. makes sense
i like 3
it could have been better tho
Meh it just felt like a game ment to play with other ppl
that too
if david is willing to get three then im down
I'm mostly a 2 person
see how cheap the handsome collection is
2 is my favorite
i also love the presequal
I could be convinced to play 3, but I have never beaten presequel, and I still need to beat all the dlc in 2
@Trashmankind PICK A GAME DAVID
1 2 3 OR PRESEQUAL

I will let Eugene decide

Pulling up in the may bike

People always say that you can't please everybody. I think that's a cop-out. Why not attempt it? Cause think of all the people that you will please if you try.

if anyone would like to help me test some early multiplayer I'd appreciate it! 🙂 it's p2p and I need to see how well it performs across the country. Just let me know and I can send you a beta key :chungus:
sure but idk how things work
that's ok! I've requested some keys from steam and when I get them, you should just have to redeem it, but then I'll send you a download link for the actual game
a steam account has to have "rights" to the game, then you can play any version of it. But you can't download it from steam because it isn't public
you say words like i should know what they mean
well you _are_ an english major

@efun @J1ngl3 valllll?
@Ron Swanson you played valorant at all
yah
I didnt really like it tbh
its really slow
and the 1v1 gun play is ackward cause they have random spray
they tried to make a try hard game to casual
a
also have no impulse control so i just yeet shit
well its a tactical shooter, and the spray is random because they want to reward good crosshair placement and not spraying
tac shooter games are inherently slow but very rewarding. the game isnt very fun casually but competitively its a blast
i do like how I have to think the opposite of overwatch, like minimize movement, and no respawning lol
My main complaint is most of my gunfights ended in being shot in the head by the dude who was moving
I felt almost constant
I feel like it's the opposite for me lol, every time I lose a fight it's cause I moved slightly but the other guy didn't
it is very well just rng
but it felt like shit to gunfight with people because of it
I could be convinced to redownload it if you guys needed more peeps. I would have to relearn viper's smokes
my first game was with efun's main and i got pooped across the map so much by the pros, forced me to take it slow the next time
how many peeps do you guys play with
i only did it with him
i swear im loyal
let me check my account
my old open division captain plays valorant competitive constantly, i could see if he'd be willing too

otherwise I don't have a ton of motivation to play through runs again lol

i wish they would have a boss rotation too
Like make the first boss have a pool of at least 3-4 diff bosses
And it would be cool if the rooms where procedurally generated at random instead of the same cookie cuttter layouts repeated.
They do have like 4-5 new guns tho

I guess I should considering he takes 0 aim amirite
Doomfist isn’t terrible either, unless I go past the target. Can’t 180 fast
gotta work on those nipple flicks
don't forget to tweak it on uppercuts
*nod nod*
*uppercuts you in both your nipples at the same time using only one hand*
aha you assume I have more than one!
I love how that's always what people say. _Satan's singular nipple???_

Basement is training
so I probs getting 20 tattoos this year
Training for a job? Starting a business? Sounds cool though
Training in general
you can't get a shop to give you an apprenticeship without knowing how the gun works, nor get licensed
theoretically I shouldn't be getting these tattoos, but since I'm not "paying" for them, it is chill
Basically I am providing a canvas because fake skin isn't a real indicator of skill or progress
For example, and he already learned this lesson on this tattoo:
you can accidentally prick the skin diagonal
and leave a puddle of ink
if it heals poorly, there is now a shadow underneath the skin
you don't really learn how not to do shit like that
unless you use a person
You can see it if you look at the bottom right corner of the top rectangle
that's pretty cool dude, good you're a willing victim while he gets better
get a tattoo removal laser too while you're at it hahahaha

PogU HAMDANCE
@Trashmankind yo sorry i didnt respond, i was taking a break from computer
all good dude 🙂
i might actually quit overwatch
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/431292613866291212/855235028376485898/fuck_this_game_21-06-17_19-55-50.mp4
kekw
never lost a game more winnable than this one
😦
My games the last couple weeks have been so tilting for me
idk what's going on
You're not having fun: might be time for a break
dude it might just be me but taking a break usually helps, its been four days since i last logged in and it didnt change
yeah I haven't been on in a couple days now just cause of that
yeah im 100 percent taking another one
I find playing games other than Overwatch can remind me how fun Overwatch can be
fair, ive been on switch more often as of late, and thinking about buying game pass
lol play mkb overwatch on console
hahahah
I'm taking a break as well lol.  Just recharging the ole batteries
i have switch ow, maybe trying that might make me go back to pc LOL
tbh i only bought it bc it was a game that came with 3 months of switch online
figured i might as well shit on it when friends are over LOL
kekw
Board games can be fun too. Makes me center after shitty video games
@Macaque has been trying ow on xbox and has been rolling people like crazy cause they're just so bad, I was hoping to join him next wednesday
bruh
i couldnt do controllers on fps unless its single player
monke, rein, ez hah
I get it tho
Junk
fuck aim
hey wait a minute
it would be cool to do it again, but i dont have a console other than switch so ;-;
@AMONG US TWERK THURSDAY dude i would mald so hard on ow for switch :LULW:
Its also going crossplay soon
just imagine
@THOT_Trap junk is the best lol.  Stop it
switch/xbone
I never said he wasn't
PogO
bro its slightly better for console control-wise, but thats it
YEP
they wont verse pc unless someone in your party is on pc
I'm saying on a controller, Junk is amaizng
Also
That is comp only
QP is going to be a shitshow cause everyone can be in it
Junk and torb are sexy af.  Like so damn sexy
:YEP:
Torb so strong, he got console nerfed
comp you can't do crossplay tho
cause separate leaderboards
Comp has three pools
am i reading that wrong?
PC only
PC and console vs pc and console
and console
you can only pc and console against other groups of pc and console
Not sure how big that pool will be
probs fucking terrible
yeah no tryhards will do that
and that's 99%
Leaving PC only, console only
QP is literally everything unless you turn it off
WHICH IS AWESOME
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/431292613866291212/855237539375480853/Capture.PNG
I thought this means you cant comp with crossplay
Unless you are so assblasted that you think your console teammates are the problem.
Wording is confusing
but I'm fairly certain that means doing with a pc player fucks you over
It says "only in non comp game modes"
The video clip may be confusing me
A-ron says that if you do group with a console player for comp, you will just be PCed
hmm
i want to shid
on the
the consosle poalyers
shid on theme
you will
i will shid on thaem
their fps is a legitimate nerf
nice
some can compensate, but I find it harder to play shooters on console than pc
I think what's actually happening is all console platforms will have one comp queue
and all pc will have one comp queue
so there technically IS crossplay comp but only ps/xbox/switch
hm
inch resting
but quickplay is all crossplay between everything
SOUNDS GREAT
NO FLAWS
Aaron may have misspoken, the writeups afterwards I would think are more accurate
There are some CRACKED console players but for the most part, PC is the go to for sweaty players
yeah just think of cod/halo pros

I relooked, his video is fucking terribly worded
and we need to harass a console player to gorup with us
wait
I have an idea
what if one of us m/kb on console
so we're basically all pc but we get the console bois
By all means
It would be assholic
but entertaining
Is it wrong to take advantage of quick play
No
which has no competitive bearing >:)
The only thing I hate is wasting peoples time
Thats impossible in overwatch thoguh
What do you mean wasting time?
in qp*
An example of something that would be wrong. Like rein flying off the cliff all game
m/kb on console, whatever
ohhhhhhh
who cares
I care 🙂

i didnt realize it was still running
I usually take long year breaks then get back to it
Guys if i never play overwatch again, its because of 10+ minute que in quickplay

Ew wtf
Terrible
This game will be the death of me
@Trashmankind i found out what the game meant by "this assignment requirement is not met"
you have to do it on a higher hazard difficulty
im assuming you were doing the lethal unlock assignment which im doing now
and it says that you have to do it on hazard lvl 4 to advance in the assignment
oooo
that makes perfect sense
im not even gonna attempt hazard lvl 4 solo lol

@AMONG US TWERK THURSDAY im gonna kill spongebob
LOL
its actually got better netcode than smash
idk what that means
to put it this way, nickkelodeons smash clone has better online conectivity and ping than smash
smash bros online is infamous for being shitty, and the fact that you pay for online along with the game being nintendos is inexcusable
third party game with shitty internet? thats most likely the third party's fault, but if its a 1st party or in house game with shit connectivity is worse, especially if your paid online services funds arent going to improving the internet problems they had/have
but does it have more users
than smash
i like smash because kirby is in it :)
i like kirby because smash is inside of him

Dollar Bill's Discount World
http://foundfootagefest.com This warehouse of crap in southern New Hampshire bought a half hour of local TV air time each week in which the owner, Dollar Bill, showcased his items in a breathless (and surprisingly sexual) way. This edit is taken from a handful of episodes from 2008 sent to us by Ken Reid. More on VCR Party Ep. 152.

Back4Blood beta today
if anyone is interested
is this L4D ish?
yes
the company that made it while part of valve
ohhhh
although, they also made Evolve
so maybe it trash
maybe it good
I thought evolve was fine though...
at least early on
idk what happened to it
It fell apart
marketing fuck up honestly
they shouldn't have tried to make it an esport
i know evolve 2 came out and i never even knew
"esport"
lol
but that was before esports were even proven to work right
yeah
too bad! Somebody has to sacrifice themselves I guess
Give B4B a try is what I'm thinking.
It has xp upgrade system
imagine if overwatch tried esports before there were ever any esports
and hero shooter skills
Yeah sounds like Vermentide
but guns
I wanna play the girl with the bat
literally a character called mom
I haven't seen much
just saw NRA sweaty man
girl
black guy
I'd prolly want to try evangelo or jim
im glad at least one of the girls isn't just a healer lol
_variety_
Probs play mom honestly
I wanna be mom
everyone wants to be a mom at some point :/
ooo
but Holly
hollys the bat girl
it'
it's cool they'll have a pvp mode
I wish vermentide had that
Maybe play doc
I didn't know there was pvp
are we hitting the kids with the quickness
yeah you can play as the ridden or cleaners
Oh man
there better be an allchatr
I bet it has evolve vibes for that mode
or maybe you're a boss that commands the hordes or something idk

good night sweet bun
i played back 4 blood for like 12 seconds @THOT_Trap but im down to play tonight
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
rachael and i may try tonight
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
she likes vermentide a lot so if it's like that in any L4D sense she should like it a lot
The pvp is a bit iffy though
need to try it more
i didnt know what was going on so i figured id wait for thot-senpai
Senpai? awwww
OxO
uwu kohai aranaer
The characters seem fun
i spawned as an old lady which i love
I ran a Holly build where I regen my own health and stamina
and isn't in conflict with reality
also i was designated as "fart18"
tru
fart17 is forbidden
Old lady pretty neat
She allows you to be downed an extra time as a team before outright dying
other farts were taken i guess
is old lady named Mom
yeah
Haha yeah
haha poor
HELL YEAH DESIGNATED MOM AT SPAWN
Hoffman pretty dope too
Sweat and full of ammunition
oh?
we love sweat
He looks like a dude in his basement packing mre
we love when you're not full of sweat cause that means the sweat has left the innards
